**See what's left of your AI subscriptions every time you open a terminal.**

ChatGPT nearly out until 3 pm? Open Claude instead. AIQuota tells you before you start the coding agent,
not halfway through a task.

- **A status band when a terminal opens**: one section per account, with a green, yellow or red dot showing how close it is to its limit
- **In the title bar**, always visible and refreshed in the background
- **Your accounts, your order**: only the ones you list are shown or queried
- **Instant**: opening a terminal never waits for the network
- **Tiny and portable**: one POSIX `sh` script that needs only `awk` and `curl`

## Install

List your accounts in the order you want them:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francescobianco/aiquota/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --display=codex,claude,copilot,freebuff
```

Then open a new terminal. This installs the script to `~/.local/bin` and adds one line to your shell's
startup file. To change the accounts or their order, run it again; the line is replaced, not duplicated:

```sh
aiquota install --display=claude,codex
```

Prefer to do it by hand? Put `bin/aiquota` in your `PATH` and add this as the **last** line of your startup file:

| Shell | File | Line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bash | `~/.bashrc` | `eval "$(aiquota init bash --display=codex,claude)"` |
| zsh | `~/.zshrc` | `eval "$(aiquota init zsh --display=codex,claude)"` |
| fish | `~/.config/fish/config.fish` | `aiquota init fish --display=codex,claude \| source` |
| dash, ash, sh, yash | `~/.profile` | `eval "$(aiquota init sh --display=codex,claude)"` |
| ksh, mksh | `~/.kshrc` | `eval "$(aiquota init ksh --display=codex,claude)"` |

## Usage

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `aiquota` | Full view with bars and reset times, refreshed if stale |
| `aiquota line` | The color band from the cache, the same one printed when a terminal opens |
| `aiquota line --plain` | The same information as plain text, for status bars |
| `aiquota title` | Writes the summary to the title bar |
| `aiquota refresh --force` | Queries everything now |
| `aiquota --display=claude,codex` | Overrides the configured accounts for one command |

### The band

```text
 ● ChatGPT Plus [5h 12% ↻1h48m] [7d 61%] ┃ ● Claude Max 5x [5h 99%] [7d 92%] ┃ ● Freebuff Free [day 100%]
```

- **The dot** is a traffic light for the account's tightest window: green from 50% left, yellow from 20%, red below that. Grey means no data, for example after a login expires.
- **`[5h 12%]`** is one window and the share left. An account can have several.
- **`↻1h48m`** is the time until that window resets, shown when less than half is left.

An empty line separates the band from your first prompt. To remove it, add `--no-blank-line` to `aiquota install` or to your startup line.

The band always stays on one row. On narrower terminals it gives up detail in this order:

| Terminal gets narrower | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Full | `ChatGPT Plus [5h 12% ↻1h48m] [7d 61%]` |
| No plan name | `ChatGPT [5h 12% ↻1h48m] [7d 61%]` |
| Short name | `GPT [5h 12% ↻1h48m] [7d 61%]` |
| Tightest window only | `GPT [5h 12% ↻1h48m]` |
| No reset time | `GPT [5h 12%]` |
| Just the share left | `GPT 12%` |
| Last accounts hidden | `GPT 12% ┃ +2` |

It uses 256 colors where available and falls back to 16 colors and plain ASCII.

### Short names

Add `--short-names` to `aiquota install` or to your startup line to always use short names in the band and the title:

| Account | `codex` | `claude` | `gemini` | `copilot` | `opencode` | `freebuff` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | ChatGPT | Claude | Gemini | Copilot | OpenCode | Freebuff |
| Short name | GPT | Cld | Gem | Cop | OpC | Fbf |

```text
 ● GPT Plus [5h 12% ↻1h48m] [7d 61%] ┃ ● Cld Max 5x [5h 99%] [7d 92%] ┃ ● Fbf Free [day 100%]
```

The full `aiquota` view keeps the complete names.

### The title bar

Title bars only show plain text, so this is a shorter summary with no colors or plan names:

```text
ChatGPT 12% 1h48m │ Claude 92% │ Freebuff 100%
```

For each account you get the share left in the window that will stop you first. The time until it resets appears when less than half is left.

A `~` before a value means it may be out of date: the login expired, the network failed, or the window
has reset since the last successful check.

To use it in a tmux status bar:

```tmux
set -g status-right '#(aiquota line --plain --display=codex,claude)'
```

## Accounts

| `--display` name | Subscription | Windows | Verified against |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | Claude Pro, Max, Team | 5h, 7d | Live API |
| `codex` | ChatGPT plans, through Codex | 5h, 7d | Live API |
| `freebuff` | Freebuff daily allowance | day | Live API |
| `copilot` | GitHub Copilot | premium, chat | Live endpoint without a subscription, and test fixtures for the quota fields |
| `opencode` | OpenCode Go | 5h, 7d, monthly | Third-party client's schema and test fixtures |
| `gemini` | Gemini Code Assist Standard, Enterprise | pro, flash | Third-party docs and test fixtures |

> [!NOTE]
> These are mostly **undocumented endpoints**, the same ones the agents use for their own usage screens.
> They can change without notice. When one does, AIQuota keeps showing the last known values, marked `~`.

### Flat subscriptions only

This is a deliberate limit, not a missing feature. AIQuota answers one question: *which of the agents I
already pay for can I still use right now?* That means quota measured in time and resources until the next
reset. API keys and metered, usage-based plans are never queried or shown, even if they are on your machine.

## Good to know

**Logins expire while you're away.** AIQuota reads each agent's credentials but never refreshes them, because
refresh tokens can rotate and using one could log you out of the agent. So after a long break an account may
show `login expired`, or its last known values marked `~`, until you next open that agent. For example, the
Claude access token lasts for hours and the ChatGPT one for days.

**It replaces your title.** If your title bar normally shows the current directory, that's what you give up.
Set `AIQUOTA_TITLE=0` before the startup line to keep your title and only get the band when a terminal opens.

**IDE terminals show the band, not the title.** The band appears each time a terminal opens, in any terminal.
JetBrains IDEs use their own fixed tab names, so the title summary doesn't appear there. In VS Code, set
`"terminal.integrated.tabs.title": "${sequence}"` to see it in the tab. In either IDE, run `aiquota` for the full view.

**Gemini is limited by Google.** Since June 2026, Gemini CLI login has only been served for Standard and
Enterprise seats, so personal accounts show `no flat subscription found`.

## Settings

Set these as environment variables before the startup line, or in `~/.config/aiquota/config`:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AIQUOTA_TTL` | `300` | Seconds between refreshes |
| `AIQUOTA_TIMEOUT` | `8` | Seconds allowed per request |
| `AIQUOTA_BANNER` | `1` | Set to `0` for no band when a terminal opens |
| `AIQUOTA_TITLE` | `1` | Set to `0` to leave the title bar alone |
| `AIQUOTA_ASCII` | unset | Set to `1` for plain ASCII output |
| `NO_COLOR` | unset | Set to anything to turn colors off |

## Privacy and security

AIQuota has no server and no telemetry. Each token goes only to the service that issued it.

- Credentials are read-only, and are never copied to the cache or passed on a command line.
- The cache in `~/.cache/aiquota` holds only plan names, percentages and times, and only you can read it.
- Text from the network is stripped of control characters before it can reach your terminal.
- Redirects are not followed, so a token can't be forwarded to another host.

## Compatibility

Runs anywhere with a POSIX shell, `awk` and `curl`.

| | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Script | Tested on dash, BusyBox ash, `bash --posix` and mksh |
| Startup hooks | Tested in a real terminal session on bash, zsh, fish, dash and mksh |
| OS | Tested on Linux. macOS runs in CI, and also reads Claude's login from the Keychain |
| Windows | Should work in WSL or Git Bash, but isn't tested yet |
