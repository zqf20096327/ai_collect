# 📧 Email Automation — AI Agent Skill

> **Ask your AI agent to use this skill to create email automation for your product — to improve sales
> and user returns.** One sentence is all it takes, and it builds out an elaborate, clean Email
> Automation section in your admin page, ready to go.

**Copy this prompt into your AI agent:**

```
Use the email-automation skill to build a complete, ready-to-go Email Automation section in my app's
admin for {{PRODUCT}} — automated lifecycle reminders that improve sales and user returns — and ship
it paused so I can review and turn it on.
```

---

> **This is an AI agent skill.** It builds a complete, non-disruptive **"Email Automation"** section
> inside your app's admin panel — turning user behaviour into personal, proven lifecycle emails that
> increase return, purchase, and retention.

Give an agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, …) this skill and it will: **scout your platform
and understand its purpose**, find the admin panel, add an **Email Automation** menu, wire up the
sequences that fit (welcome, abandoned cart, post-purchase, upsell, win-back, **email verification,
profile completion, onboarding, KYC, trial/billing, booking, renewal**…), and ship it **paused** so
nothing breaks and nothing sends until you say so.

## What it builds

| Piece | What the admin gets |
|-------|---------------------|
| 📨 **Sequences** | 9 lifecycle sequences, each on/off, with editable delays, discounts, and copy |
| ✍️ **Template editor** | a **free, self-hosted WYSIWYG editor** (TinyMCE Community; or Quill/TipTap/Summernote/GrapesJS) to edit each email body — email-safe HTML, merge tokens, preview + test-send |
| 🧩 **Editable sequences** | admin can **add / reorder / delete steps**; a new step also schedules for active enrolments |
| ▶️ **Sequence controls** | **Start / Pause / Delete** each sequence — delete requires typing **`delete`** in a confirmation modal, then soft-deletes (restorable) |
| 🧭 **Clean admin** | calm, uncluttered layout — ≤3 tabs, one primary action per view, details in drawers, secondary actions in an overflow menu |
| 🎨 **Designed with the UI/UX laws skill** | the page is built under `ui-ux-20-laws` — every decision (tabs, targets, drawers, states) is mapped to a law, with a Trace block + pre-ship checklist |
| 🧠 **Platform-aware sequences** | scouts your app's purpose and adds the reminders that fit — **email verification, profile completion, onboarding, KYC, billing/trial, booking, renewal**… |
| 📣 **Multi-channel** | **email · push · WhatsApp · SMS** — reuses existing providers or lets the admin add API keys; users opt in per channel |
| 💰 **Payday re-engagement** | a separate **27th → last day → 2nd** reminder set for still-pending products; **Leads → Paid** on purchase; per-product opt-out |
| 🩺 **Health checks** | banners when emails can't send: **paused**, **cron not running** (with exact fix commands), **no SMTP/API key** (with setup steps) |
| 👤 **User controls** | search a user by email, expand their sequence with a caret, **cancel one specific email** or **exclude the user** from all automation |
| 🗂️ **Recipients log** | every user + emails sent/scheduled, **paginated by 100**, with *when* and *why* |
| 📊 **Statistics** | of those who got reminders, how many converted + revenue, charted by day/week/month |
| ⚙️ **Settings** | sender (from-name/email, reply-to, address), master pause, caps, quiet hours |
| 🛒 **Admin-only tables** | on **product & checkout** pages: **Leads** / **Paid** — email → profile, phone → call, caret → emails sent/scheduled. Disable-able from Settings |
| 🛡️ **Safety** | ships **paused**, global kill switch, no change to existing flows, reuse the app's email connection |

**Icons make it feel finished.** The page ships with a **single, consistent icon family** — it reuses
your app's existing set (Lucide/Heroicons/Material/Phosphor) or falls back to **Lucide**. Icons label the
nav, tabs, sequence actions (`▶` start, `⏸` pause, `✎` edit, `🗑` delete), statuses (`✓` sent, `⏱`
scheduled, `✕` cancelled, `⚠` failed), the Leads/Paid tabs, and each channel (`📧` `🔔` `💬` `📱`). Every
icon-only control keeps a 44px target and an accessible name, and icons never replace the label on a
primary or destructive action. A ready-to-use sprite is in `examples/icons.svg`; the rules and full map
are in `references/iconography.md`. **See it rendered:** `examples/admin-preview.html`.

## The sequences (research-backed funnel timing)

| # | Sequence | Trigger | Timing | Discount |
|---|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | 👋 **Welcome / activate** | Registration | 0h → 24h → 72h | 0% |
| 2 | 🔑 **Registered, never logged in** | Registered + no login | 1h → 24h → 72h | 0% |
| 3 | 😴 **Logged in, no purchase/use** | Inactive after login | 1h → 24h → 5d | 0% |
| 4 | 🛒 **Abandoned cart / checkout / product** | Cart/checkout/product, no purchase | **1h (no discount) → 24h social proof → 48–72h urgency + discount** | up to 10% on step 3 |
| 5 | ⭐ **Post-purchase review** | Purchase (product-type aware) | next day → 2 weeks | 0% |
| 6 | 🚀 **Upsell / cross-sell** | Purchase, other products exist | after value moment (3–7d) | optional |
| 7 | 🔁 **Win-back** | Inactive 30/60/90d | neutral → value → "we'll stop" | optional |
| 8 | 📦 **Replenishment** | Consumable product | ~day 45–60 | optional |
| 9 | 💸 **Payday re-engage** | Pending product lead ≥ 7 days | 27th → last day → 2nd | optional |

**Payday is a nurture sequence** — per product, runs alongside the cart reminder, and shares the
one-email-per-day cap so it never clashes. On purchase the user moves **Leads → Paid** and enters the
paid-product sequences. A product reminder's "unsubscribe" opts out of **that one sequence for that
product** (shown as "Manually exited this sequence" beside the caret).

**Discount rule:** default **0%** — and at 0% the email **never mentions a discount**.

---

## The non-disruptive guarantee

1. **Studies before it builds** — stack, admin, auth, products, cart, email connection.
2. **Additive only** — new tables/routes; never rewrites existing auth, cart, checkout, or user flows.
3. **Reuses the app's email connection** — no second SMTP/provider.
4. **Ships paused** — master switch OFF; the admin is prompted to review and turn it on (the agent can
   help).
5. **Per-user, not mass** — cron-driven, one email at a time, with frequency caps and stop conditions.
6. **Rollback** — disable stops all sends; dropping the new tables removes it cleanly.

---

## 📣 Channels — email, push, WhatsApp, SMS

Reminders go out on **📧 email, 🔔 push notifications, 💬 WhatsApp, and 📱 SMS**. The skill **detects and
reuses** whatever the app already has (FCM/APNs/OneSignal, Twilio/Vonage, WhatsApp Cloud API). If a
channel is missing, the admin adds its API key on **Settings → Channels** and sends a test.

Users are asked to opt in at the right moment — the push permission prompt, or a verified phone number
with an unchecked consent box for SMS/WhatsApp. Only opted-in channels are used, and email stays the
always-available fallback. Each channel has its own consent, suppression, limits, and quiet hours.

## What makes the emails good

- ✍️ **Personal, from one person** — `Dave from NoteVault`, a monitored reply-to, references the exact
  product. Example:

  > *Hi Dave, I noticed you wanted to buy the Sony Xmax TV but haven't completed the payment. Is
  > anything blocking you? You can finish here — and I've added 10% off if you complete it in the next
  > 24 hours.*

- 🎯 **One clear CTA** and a **"contact admin" link in every email**.
- 📬 **Deliverability-safe**: SPF/DKIM/DMARC, branded domain, HTML + plain-text, no spam trigger words,
  unsubscribe + physical address (CAN-SPAM/GDPR).
- 📱 **Client-agnostic**: table-based HTML, inline CSS, ~600px, alt text, dark-mode aware.

## Pull it & start using

Copy this prompt into your agent:

```
Pull the email-automation skill from
https://github.com/davepartner/email-automation-AI-Agent-skill (pin it by tag or commit), read
SKILL.md, and build the Email Automation section into this app:

1. DISCOVER first: identify the stack, the admin panel, the existing email connection, and the
   products / cart / checkout / orders / user models. Produce a one-screen integration plan and show
   me it BEFORE writing code. If there is no admin panel, ask me whether to create one.
2. Build it additively (new tables/routes only) with a feature flag, and SHIP IT PAUSED.
3. Add the "Email Automation" admin menu with tabs: Sequences (with stats) · Users & recipients ·
   Settings (sender, channels, caps, pause).
4. Wire the sequences (welcome, no-login, inactive, abandoned cart, post-purchase review, upsell,
   win-back, replenishment, payday re-engagement) with personal copy, stop conditions, and discounts
   (0% = no mention).
5. Add admin-only Leads/Paid tables to product & checkout pages, hide-able from Settings.
6. Use one consistent icon set (reuse mine, else Lucide) across tabs, actions, statuses and channels.
7. Reuse the existing email connection; no mass email; respect caps + unsubscribe.
8. Give me a preview/test-send and a rollback doc, then ask if you should turn it on.
```

## Strengths & limitations

**Strengths**
- **Behaviour-triggered, not blasts** — each email is personal and per-user.
- **Proven timing** — 1h cart reminder, 24h social proof, 48–72h urgency; day-1 + 2-week post-purchase.
- **Tested engine** — the scheduler/worker core ships as runnable code with tests (idempotency,
  stop-conditions, frequency caps, crash recovery).
- **Non-disruptive, verified** — additive + reversible migrations, hook isolation, smoke test, rollback
  drill; paused by default.
- **Operational compliance** — signed one-click unsubscribe, preference center, consent capture,
  bounce/complaint webhooks, retention.
- **Measurable & honest** — last-touch attribution with a holdout group to estimate true lift.

**Limitations**
- **Sending depends on the app's existing mail setup** — if that is broken, reminders fail too.
- **Behaviour tracking quality varies** — a custom app without events may need polling/observers (lower
  fidelity than a clean event bus).
- **Attribution still needs volume** — even with last-touch + a holdout, small samples are noisy; treat
  lift as directional until you have data.
- **Deliverability is earned** — new domains need warm-up; the skill is only as good as sender reputation.
- **Timezone/quiet-hours** use the stored per-user UTC offset; if it is missing, sending falls back to
  the admin window. Offsets are fixed at enrolment — for dates months ahead, resolve the offset for the
  target date so DST is correct.
- **The reference worker is in-memory** — the tests cover decision logic, not real `SKIP LOCKED` DB
  concurrency; add a Postgres integration test before production.
