</p>

Overseer is a desktop app (Linux, macOS, Windows), a phone and tablet app (Android, iOS) and a small
daemon. It works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, opencode, Amp, Copilot CLI, Cursor
Agent and Mistral Vibe. Each agent session is a **line**: one agent, in one worktree, on one machine, for
one owner. The daemon owns the terminals, so closing the app, losing Wi-Fi or putting the laptop
to sleep stops nothing; open the app again and every session is where you left it.

New here? Install the app, open it, and take the tour: it shows each part of the window in about
a minute. You can replay it any time from Settings → Help.

## Features

### Every agent in one window

Workspaces group sessions by project. Inside a workspace, subjects sort its sessions further: a
subject covers a sub-folder or a git submodule (submodules show up on their own), sessions running
there join it, and you can drag any session onto one or start a new one in it, at the workspace
root if your agents read their instructions there. Each session opens in a tab with its live terminal, and
the side panel shows what the agent is doing: last message, work log, todos, edited files and
changes. Switch to **By status** to see at a glance who needs your input, who is running and who
is done. Agent tabs also have a **Chat** view rebuilt live from the agent's session file.
Terminals can optionally be drawn on the GPU with WebGL (Settings, Terminal, **GPU rendering**,
off by default and experimental), which keeps long output smooth. Clicking in the line you are
typing, in a shell or an agent like Claude Code or Codex, moves the cursor there like in a text editor.
The **+** menus list only the agents you have installed; the rest wait under **Not installed**,
where one click runs an agent's install command in a new terminal, then it is ready to start.
Coming from Switchboard, the old name of Overseer? When its data is found, Overseer offers to import
your sessions, tasks, workspaces and settings in one click (also in Settings, Help).

</details>

### A task board that starts agents for you

Write a task, pick the agent, its model and reasoning effort, and start it: Overseer creates a
worktree on a new branch and types the task into the agent. Tasks in the **Auto** column start on
their own, in order, within your concurrency limit. A new task can be filled from the project's
GitHub or GitLab issues or Jira tickets, and agents can read and update tasks through the
built-in MCP server. Finished work waits in **Review**; a task moves to **Merged** by itself once
its branch lands in the default branch, **Closed** keeps the rest, and an agent moves its task
back to In progress when work resumes. Tick **Quorum** on a Claude or Codex task and its agent
splits the work between several agent CLIs; one or two other agents review each result and vote
with the orchestrator, and only results a majority accepts are merged.

</details>

### Live review of what agents change

A GitHub-style review of an agent's changes while it works. Comment on lines, suggest edits, and
send the comments back to the agent; threads follow the code as it changes. Approve, reject or
commit from the Kanban card when the task is in Review. When an agent works across several
repositories, one review covers them all: the Map view draws every worktree on one map with the
links between files, colours each file by what makes it worth your attention (real logic, blast
radius, contract changes, where the agent struggled, untested or not yet seen code), and J and K
walk the files hottest first.

### Source control, Git graph and worktrees

The git button above each session opens its live review: the agent stays on the left, the
review of everything it changed sits beside it, the sidebar shrinks to a rail of sessions, and one
bar at the bottom runs git on the worktree you pick among the session's worktrees and submodules.
Write a message and press Enter to commit; Push, Publish or Pull takes the button's place when it
is the next step, and the ⋯ menu holds fetch, amend, stage or discard all, merge, stash and the Git
graph. While you work in a terminal, the sidebar's **Git** tab (Ctrl+Shift+G) keeps source control at
hand like VS Code: the selected session's worktree, its branch, fetch, pull and push, a commit box,
staged and changed files, and merge and stash. The Git graph tab keeps a per-project history that stays fast on large histories, with agent
branches, tasks and PRs on it; from a commit you can merge it into a worktree or revert it.
Worktrees live in one store outside your repositories, show whether they are in use, idle
or stale, and are cleaned up safely: **Clean up merged** picks the merged ones with no agent left,
and you untick the ones to keep.

![Worktrees](app/docs/screenshots/worktrees-dark.png)

### Remote machines over SSH

Point the app at any host that works with `ssh <host>`: your `~/.ssh/config`, `ProxyJump`,
`ProxyCommand`, agents and keys are used as is. The app installs the daemon on first connection
and carries terminals, events and forwarded ports over a single SSH connection. Nothing listens
on a TCP port on the server.

Keep each host in its own window, or put this computer and several SSH hosts in one window:
each host gets a live section in the sidebar, and a click on one of its sessions brings it into
the main area. One window per host stays the default; pick the other in Settings or when you
connect.

### And also

- **Phone and tablet apps** for Android and iOS (iPhone and iPad), synced with the desktop: follow
  and answer your agents from anywhere ([docs/mobile.md](docs/mobile.md)). Tablets get the phone
  layout in portrait and the full desktop layout, with touch, in landscape.

  </p>
- **Demo mode**: no server yet? **Try the demo** on the connect screen runs the whole app on sample
  sessions, tasks, reviews and chats, on the desktop or a phone, with nothing installed. A **Demo
  mode** pill stays in the title bar; **Exit demo** returns to your own hosts and settings, untouched.
- **Notifications** when an agent needs input or finishes, from agent hooks Overseer can
  install for you.
- **Agent profiles**: save each CLI's supported model and effort choices, plus named subagent models
  for Gemini CLI and Antigravity. Apply a profile to new work, scope it to a workspace or to a task
  type (a bug fix and a migration in the same repo start with different models), and choose when
  to update the agent files.
- **Auto-approve defaults per agent**: choose which CLIs Overseer starts in their native
  auto-approval mode, one by one or all at once. The defaults are stored on each connected host and
  apply to new sessions.
- **Skills and plugins in one click**: install RTK (trims shell output before the agent reads it),
  Caveman (terse replies) or Ponytail (simplest code that works) for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI,
  opencode, Copilot CLI, Cursor Agent, Amp, Antigravity or Mistral Vibe, from Settings → Agents or the command
  palette. The install runs in a terminal you can watch.
- **Agents stay in their project**: task agents message each other only within the same
  project, so they coordinate on shared files without spending tokens on unrelated repositories.
  Settings → Defaults → Agents message each other turns their messages off entirely.
- **Side tasks or autonomous agents**: when an agent finds a bug outside its task while working,
  merging or reviewing, it can file it as a new task on the board or fix it itself. Settings →
  Defaults → Agents file what they find as tasks picks which.
- **Sticky notes on sessions**: click the note icon of a session in the sidebar to leave yourself
  notes on it, like comments. They are never sent to the agent and stay with the session.

  <img src="app/docs/screenshots/sticky-notes-dark.png" width="720" alt="Sticky notes on a session">

- **Usage and system monitor**: agent quotas, token usage, CPU and RAM in the title bar.
- **Real cost per session and task**: what each session cost, from the token counts in its
  transcript, per model with cache reads and writes apart and model switches shown as their own
  cost. Tabs and task cards carry the total, and the usage view compares the cost per finished
  task by profile, ticket or task, so you can see whether a cheaper profile really saves money.
- **Keep agents running with the lid closed**: an opt-in switch (Settings → Connection) stops the
  laptop running Overseer from sleeping when you close it, on Linux, macOS and Windows, so agents
  finish their work with the network on. It drains the battery, and the switch says so.
- **Light and Dark palettes**: choose System, Light or Dark as the theme (System follows your OS live), then pick a palette for each mode: Default, Graphite or Solarized Soft for Dark, or make your own with color pickers, a live preview and a contrast warning. Find them in Settings → General → Appearance ([Graphite](app/docs/screenshots/graphite.png), [Solarized Soft](app/docs/screenshots/solarized.png)).
- **Settings with search**: categories in a sidebar, and a search box that finds any setting by name or description, in your language or in English.
- **Command palette** (history, actions, sessions) and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Organize my sessions**: a proposed workspace layout you approve before anything moves.
- **Built-in browser** and port forwarding for the dev servers your agents start; the Ports panel
  lists them and stops any one an agent left running in the background.
- **Team mode**: a shared API merges every station's lines, relays commands between stations,
  and publishes events and signed webhooks for other tools.
- **Updates** in the app, and a feedback button with optional diagnostics.
- **Record a bug**: show a problem while Overseer logs your clicks, shortcuts, views and errors next to a screen video, then send both in one report. Replay plays the video and the timeline in sync; what you type is never logged.

## Install

### macOS (Homebrew)

Install the desktop app, and the `overseer` CLI/daemon if you want it on this machine:

```sh
brew install --cask basilelt/tap/overseer
brew install --formula basilelt/tap/overseer
```

The full `basilelt/tap/...` name taps the repository and tells Homebrew to trust these packages,
so no `brew trust` or `--trust` step is needed. Homebrew is only the first install: the app
updates itself afterwards (see [Updates](#updates)) and the cask declares `auto_updates true`, so
`brew upgrade` leaves it alone. To upgrade the `overseer` CLI/daemon formula, run
`brew update && brew upgrade --formula basilelt/tap/overseer`.

The app is signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple, so macOS opens it without a
warning. Each release asset carries a build provenance attestation:
`gh attestation verify <file> --repo basilelt/overseer` checks a download came from this
repository's release workflow.

### Linux and Windows

Download from the latest release (`.AppImage`, `.deb` or `.rpm` on Linux x64 and arm64,
`-setup.exe` or `.msix` on Windows x64 and arm64). The Linux builds need glibc 2.35 or newer
(Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora 36 and later). The `.msix` is self-signed: import
`overseer-msix.cer` from the release into Local Machine > Trusted People once, then open the
`.msix`. Every one of these installs updates itself from the app afterwards. For example:

```sh
gh release download --repo basilelt/overseer --pattern '*.AppImage'
chmod +x Overseer_*.AppImage
```

The `overseer` CLI/daemon alone is a single static binary per platform
(`overseer-<version>-<target>`), e.g. `--pattern '*-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl'`. Remote hosts
need nothing: the app installs the daemon over SSH on first connection.

### Android and iOS

Android: install and update the APK from the releases with Obtainium
([add it in one tap](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/redirect?r=obtainium://app/%7B%22id%22%3A%22io.github.basilelt.overseer%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbasilelt%2Foverseer%22%2C%22author%22%3A%22basilelt%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22Overseer%22%2C%22preferredApkIndex%22%3A0%2C%22additionalSettings%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22includePrereleases%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22apkFilterRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22Overseer_.%2A_android%5C%5C%5C%5C.apk%5C%22%2C%5C%22invertAPKFilter%5C%22%3Afalse%7D%22%2C%22overrideSource%22%3A%22GitHub%22%7D), settings prefilled), or download it with
`gh release download --repo basilelt/overseer --pattern '*android.apk'`. Google Play gets a
release now and then, shipped by hand; Play builds are updated by Play instead of the in-app
updater. iOS: [Overseer Agents on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overseer-agents/id6830960534), or join the [TestFlight beta](#testflight-ios-beta). Store versions lag behind the GitHub releases. See
[docs/mobile.md](docs/mobile.md).

#### Google Play (closed testing)

Overseer is in closed testing on Google Play before its public release. Testers get it for free
with a promo code. To install it from Play and get updates there:

1. With the Google account of your Android phone, join the
   [Overseer testers group](https://groups.google.com/g/overseer-testers) ("Join group").
2. Open the [testing invitation](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.github.basilelt.overseer.pro)
   with the same account and tap **Become a tester**. If it says the app is not available, the
   group join has not reached Play yet: wait a few minutes and reload.
3. Get a free promo code: in the group, open the pinned **Free promo codes** post and its code
   sheet, take the first code nobody has claimed and write your name next to it. Each code works
   once.
4. Redeem it with the same account: tap its redeem link, or in the Play Store app, your profile
   picture > **Payments & subscriptions** > **Redeem code**. Overseer is then yours at no cost;
   install it from the
   [Play Store page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.basilelt.overseer.pro).
   Updates arrive through Play like any app.
5. Stay in the group and keep the app installed: Play only opens the app to everyone after
   testers have used it for 14 days. Send feedback from the app (More > Send feedback) or on the
   Play listing.

No code left? Ask in the group.

No server yet? Tap **Try the demo** on the first screen to explore the app with sample data.

Already using the APK from the releases? The Play build is signed with a different key, so
Android will not install it over the APK: uninstall the APK first (your servers have to be added
again). From then on Play updates the app instead of the in-app updater.

#### TestFlight (iOS beta)

Overseer for iPhone and iPad is in public beta on TestFlight before its App Store release:

1. Install [TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/app/testflight/id899247664) from the App Store.
2. Open the [Overseer TestFlight invitation](https://testflight.apple.com/join/DZgZFcMk) on your
   iPhone or iPad and tap **Accept**, then **Install**. If it says the beta is full or not
   accepting testers, try again later.
3. New builds arrive through TestFlight; each build expires after 90 days, so keep TestFlight
   updates on. Send feedback from the app (More > Send feedback) or with **Send Beta Feedback**
   in TestFlight.

### Uninstall

Before deleting the app, use **Settings, Connection, Remove Overseer from this computer**: it lists
and removes the agent hooks, statusline, boot service and folders Overseer added (worktrees with
uncommitted changes are kept). The Windows uninstaller and `brew uninstall --zap --cask overseer`
do it for you; on a server run `overseer uninstall --apply`. See the
[user guide](docs/user-guide.md#uninstall).

### Updates

The desktop app updates itself from the public GitHub releases; no token or sign-in is needed,
and it never runs Homebrew. Whatever way you installed it, one **Download & install** button
fetches the update that matches that install and applies it:

- **macOS** (from the `.dmg` or the Homebrew cask): the app is replaced in place, then **Restart
  to finish**.
- **Linux AppImage**: the AppImage is replaced in place.
- **Linux `.deb` or `.rpm`**: the signed package of the release is downloaded and installed with
  `dpkg -i` or `rpm -U` through `pkexec`, so the system asks for your password; then restart.
- **Windows `-setup.exe`**: the signed installer runs in passive mode.
- **Windows `.msix`**: the matching x64 or arm64 `.msix` is downloaded, checked against the
  release `SHA256SUMS`, and Windows App Installer opens it; click **Update** there.

## Components

- `overseer`: CLI and daemon of a station. Reads the agents' sessions, tmux and git; installs
  agent hooks on request; serves a local API on a Unix socket; syncs with the API.
- `overseer-api`: shared registry (Rust, SQLite). Station and user tokens, merged reads,
  command relay and audit, SSE events, webhooks, `POST /v1/lines` for feedback-hub.
- Board: web page served by the daemon on loopback; lines grouped by ticket, PR and CI, actions.
- Desktop app support (in the daemon): terminals owned by the daemon, a local task Kanban that
  starts agents in worktrees, an activity panel from transcripts, an MCP server for agents, a
  per-project git graph, worktrees managed in one store outside the repositories with safe
  cleanup ([ADR 0031](docs/adr/0031-git-graph-and-worktrees.md)), and a server mode reached over
  SSH ([contract](contract/app-daemon.md), user guide section 14).
- [Desktop app](app/README.md): Tauri client for the daemon, local or remote over SSH; terminals,
  activity, diffs and a task board.

## CLI quickstart

```
make build                                   # target/release/overseer, target/release/overseer-api
cp target/release/overseer ~/.local/bin/
export OVERSEER_STATE_DIR=~/.local/state/overseer

overseer ls                               # this station's lines
overseer doctor                           # what is installed and what is missing
overseer hooks install                    # dry run; add --apply to write

overseer daemon --http 127.0.0.1:0 &      # daemon with the Board
overseer board                            # prints the Board URL

printf '%s\n' "$STATION_TOKEN" | overseer enroll --api http://api.example.com:8080
overseer sync --once                      # push this station's lines to the API
printf '%s\n' "$USER_TOKEN" | overseer login --api http://api.example.com:8080
```

State lives in `~/.local/state/overseer` (Linux) or `~/Library/Application Support/overseer` (macOS); `OVERSEER_STATE_DIR` overrides it, and `bin/overseer` defaults it to `<checkout>/.state`.
Service files for the daemon and sync (systemd user units, launchd agents) and a runner image are
in `deploy/`; Overseer never installs them.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains how to propose a change,
and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the rules every change follows (stability, energy, tests, one
draft PR per feature). [app/README.md](app/README.md) covers the app's development loop and the
mock daemon. `make test` and `make lint` run offline; tmux tests use an isolated server. Report
security problems privately, as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Develop while using the installed app

`scripts/dev.sh` runs Overseer built from your checkout next to the Overseer you use every day,
without touching it: the dev daemon gets its own `HOME`, state directory and tmux server under
`~/.overseer-dev` (`OVERSEER_DEV_DIR` changes it), and the dev desktop app runs under its own
bundle id, `io.github.basilelt.overseer.dev`, so its settings, windows and macOS permissions are
separate too.

```sh
scripts/dev.sh up       # build the daemon from this checkout and start it
scripts/dev.sh app      # desktop app in dev mode (pnpm tauri dev) on the dev daemon
scripts/dev.sh status   # is the dev daemon running?
scripts/dev.sh down     # stop the dev daemon; its tmux sessions keep running
scripts/dev.sh reset    # stop everything dev and delete ~/.overseer-dev
```

No code signing is needed: `tauri dev` runs an unbundled binary you built, which Gatekeeper does
not block. Signing only concerns the released `.app` (see [docs/ci.md](docs/ci.md#macos-signing)).
The dev app is a different app to macOS, so it may ask for Local Network access on its own. The dev `HOME` starts
with a copy of your `~/.gitconfig` and nothing else: agents started from the dev daemon are not
logged in until you log in from one of its terminals (for example `claude`, then `/login`). For UI work
alone, `pnpm dev` in `app/` runs the frontend in a browser on the mock daemon.

Never start a daemon from a checkout with your real `HOME` (for example
`OVERSEER_STATE_DIR=$PWD/.state target/debug/overseer daemon`): a daemon on a state directory other
than the default one does not repair your global agent hooks or `~/.overseer/bin/overseer` (it
logs why), but it shares your agents, tmux and files. Give it its own `HOME`, as `scripts/dev.sh`
and `scripts/qa/sandbox.sh` do.
