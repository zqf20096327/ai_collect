# AgentFleet · Cross-Device AI Orchestration — Every device a ship. AgentFleet is the fleet.

[![AgentFleet — Every device a ship. AgentFleet is the fleet.](docs/images/banner.png)](docs/images/banner.png)

AgentFleet is a **self-hosted cross-device AI orchestration layer**. It doesn't build new agents — it coordinates the AI agents **you've already installed** (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Aider, Gemini, Qwen, Grok and 10+ more) into one fleet, so you can run multiple coding agents across machines, watch them work on a live neural graph, and keep tamper-evident shared memory. Unlike multi-agent frameworks that rebuild agents from scratch, AgentFleet sits **above** what you already run.

## ⚡ Performance (reproducible)

Cross-device scheduling is benchmarked, and every number below is produced by scripts in this repo — run them yourself.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Scheduler throughput (200 tasks) | **300 tasks/s** (4 devices × 2 agents, simulated exec) |
| Scheduler throughput (1000 tasks) | **347 tasks/s** (4 devices × 2 agents, simulated exec) |
| Scheduler throughput (8 devices × 24 agents, 1000 tasks, device killed mid-run) | **353 tasks/s**, lost = 0 (simulated exec) |
| Real multi-device throughput | **38 tasks/s** (2 devices × 2 agents, real ws link) |
| Scheduling latency p50 / p90 / p99 | **339 / 592 / 639 ms** |
| Disconnect detection | **~1 s** (was ~35 s) |
| Task loss when a device dies mid-run | **0** — running tasks are re-queued and re-dispatched |
| Real cloud servers, zero login | **5/5 completed** (1 Ubuntu + 2 Windows, real codex/claude CLI, no OpenAI/Anthropic account) |
| One-time scheduling fix | **~30×** throughput after removing three O(n²) DB lookups from the dispatch loop |

> Rows marked *simulated exec* measure the scheduler with `setTimeout`-based fake tasks, not real CLI runs — they isolate scheduling cost from agent cost. The 349 ↔ 353 spread between two runs of the same config is run-to-run noise (±1.5%), not a speedup from killing a device. The one real-link number is the 38 tasks/s row.

```bash
npm run benchmark --workspace backend                     # scheduler core (mock devices)
npm run benchmark:multi --workspace backend               # real multi-device (1 backend + N device processes)
npm run benchmark --workspace backend -- --fail-at 100    # failover
```

## ✨ Features

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cross-device orchestration** | Auto-detect 14 AI agent platforms per device via a data-driven adapter catalog; unified task protocol (submit / stream / cancel) |
| **Dynamic neural graph** | Deterministic three-lane flow layout (device → agent → task): card nodes with text labels, orange/cyan flow particles for task dispatch/return, pulse rings for busy/error |
| **Cross-device memory ledger** | Append-only hash chain + Merkle tree + Ed25519 signature — blocks broadcast to every device with offline catch-up + gap recovery + tamper rejection; BM25 semantic search |
| **Memory resilience** | Survives single-fleet & cross-fleet context loss: device restart, disconnection, long offline (50+ blocks) and tampering all keep memory intact — verified by `memory/tests/resilience.test.ts` |
| **Smart routing gateway** | Built-in modelgateway workspace with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint; role-based routing (role → device + agent + model), failover and token ledger |
| **Excel batch deployment** | Upload an Excel sheet (device IP / account / password / SSH port); auto-probes the target OS, bootstraps Node.js/pipx, then installs agents via npm / pipx / brew / winget and verifies each install — validated on real Ubuntu + Windows servers |
| **One-click uninstall** | Generate OS-aware uninstall scripts (npm / pipx / brew / winget) and verify the commands are really gone — still behind human confirmation |
| **Deploy-then-use** | A deployment target can carry a deviceId + platform models; on success the device+agent is bound to the routing gateway model |
| **Platform model failover** | Configure a primary + fallback model per device agent; auto-switch on failure, degrade to local when all fail, with manual switch/reset |
| **Per-device team mode** | Bind each device to a different team (A = software team, B = content team); `target.mode='team'` routes only to that team's devices |
| **Asset distribution** | Unified Asset model for rules / knowledge / skills / prompts, delivered to one device or a whole swarm |
| **Prompt library** | Live-fetch the most-starred prompt collections on GitHub (e.g. `f/prompts.chat`, 175k★), parse individual prompts with bilingual notes, and batch-distribute to the swarm |
| **Skills library** | Live-fetch the most-starred skills on GitHub, expand repositories to import individual `SKILL.md` entries, with bilingual descriptions |
| **Expert teams & loops** | Assign expert teams (role routing) to single/cross-device agent teams; orchestrate single/batch/cross-device loops |
| **Primary AI agent** | Set a primary AI agent per device or in batch — auto-routing prefers it |
| **Free-source rating** | Live chat probes against Kilo / OpenCode, rated 优/中/差; keep only 优 and 中 |
| **Auto check-in** | Startup check-in + scheduled auto check-in + audit for free sources that award credits via check-in |
| **Model Nexus** | Inspired by EchoBird: batch configure paid Providers, mask API keys, persist them in the local ignored directory, and reuse them across the whole fleet |
| **Onboarding guide** | First-run guide explains the device fleet → modelgateway → Provider → deploy-then-use → failover workflow |
| **WeChat assistant** | Enterprise WeChat (official API) + personal WeChat (interface reserved) as a chat-based task entry |
| **A2A endpoint** | Agent Card (`/.well-known/agent.json`) + JSON-RPC `tasks/send` / `tasks/get` / `tasks/cancel` — external agents discover and delegate to the fleet |
| **Sub-second failover** | Device death detected in ~1s (ws ping/pong + fast heartbeat, was ~35s); running tasks auto-migrate to surviving devices — zero loss |
| **Memory insights** | Semantic consolidation layer turns the change stream into success rate / per-agent distribution / failure lessons — memory you can search *and* learn from |

## 🧩 Supported agent platforms and responsibility boundaries

AgentFleet can **deploy / uninstall / discover / route multiple agent platforms**, but local CLI execution and modelgateway execution are two different paths:

- **Install / uninstall**: 14 platforms are mapped to OS-aware npm / pipx / brew / winget / manual-verify scripts, with post-install or post-uninstall verification.
- **Discover / report**: the per-device daemon detects installed platforms and reports them as workers inside that device fleet.
- **Deploy-then-use**: a deployment target can carry `deviceId + platform models`; after a successful deployment AgentFleet binds the device+agent platform to built-in modelgateway models and runs tasks through the gateway first.
- **Local CLI direct execution**: `grok` is the currently stable direct adapter; the other platforms have discovery and dispatch scaffolding, but their headless flags, login state and output formats must be verified per platform before they are marked stable.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Node.js v24 (e.g. `nvm use 24`). On some systems `better-sqlite3` is built against a specific Node version — make sure `node -v` prints v24.

```bash
npm install

# coordinator :4173
npm run dev:backend

# dashboard :5173 (opens in demo mode even with zero devices)
npm run dev:frontend

# per-device daemon (set COORDINATOR_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:4173 if mDNS is blocked)
npm run dev:agent

# built-in model routing gateway :18765 (or start it from the Deploy page)
npm run dev:gateway

# cloud relay :4174 · WeChat gateway :4175
npm run dev:relay
npm run dev:wechat

# full build + tests
npm run build
npm run test --workspace memory
```

**Demo mode**: with no devices connected, the dashboard automatically plays a live cross-device simulation — tasks flow through `queued → running → completed`, stream particles animate, device load updates, and a phone node toggles online/offline.

## 📚 Documentation

See [`docs/`](docs/) for 27 documents: reverse-engineering of Grok's orchestration, PRD, architecture, UI design, the blockchain memory ledger design, routing-gateway fusion, free-source integration, platform model binding, management UI, EchoBird-inspired Model Nexus notes, the agent platform capability matrix, the cross-device memory sync design, and the WorkBuddy platform integration guide.

## 🔒 Safety

- Deployment passwords are **never persisted** (in-memory only, cleared after use).
- Deploy / uninstall / asset-deliver / loop-start all require an explicit **human confirmation gate** before any outbound action.

## 🧪 Verification

```bash
# Backend unit + integration tests (per-device teams, uninstall, free-source fallback)
npm run test --workspace backend

# Memory ledger tests — including resilience (restart / disconnect / tamper / catch-up)
npm run test --workspace memory

# Probe real free sources (Kilo / OpenCode + local modelgateway)
npm run probe:free --workspace backend
```

The memory resilience suite (`memory/tests/resilience.test.ts`) simulates the context-loss scenarios that matter — a device restart, a fleet member going offline for 50+ blocks, a tampered block mid-catch-up, and out-of-order/duplicate blocks — and asserts the memory is never lost and stays searchable.
