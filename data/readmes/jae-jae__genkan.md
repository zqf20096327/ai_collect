## AI-first

Genkan is built to be driven by an AI assistant. Point Claude, Cursor or any AI agent at it and just say what you want:

> *"Group my services by type and pin the five I use most."*
>
> *"Add Jellyfin, Sonarr and Radarr at nas.lan to Media and enable health checks."*
>
> *"Find dead links and move them to an Archive category."*

Changes land immediately and the open page updates live. There are two alternative ways to connect an agent: an Agent Skill (source in [`skills/genkan/`](skills/genkan); it uses the REST API with curl, no MCP setup needed) or the built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server with 13 tools. Live updates use SSE, and everything stays local on your own server.

**Pick one** (Settings → AI shows both with your real values; one API token covers everything):

1. **Skill (recommended):** Settings → AI → copy the setup prompt and send it to your AI assistant; it installs the Skill and your token (or download the package there and unzip it into `~/.claude/skills/`).
2. **MCP (alternative):** `claude mcp add --transport http genkan http://<host>:8080/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"` (a generic JSON snippet is there too).

> [!WARNING]
> The token is full admin access and is embedded in the setup prompt and MCP snippets. Never share or commit them; regenerate the token if it leaks.

The REST API (which the Skill uses) and the MCP tools are described in [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md).

## Features

- **AI-native**: organize via a one-click Skill (REST API) or the built-in MCP server; changes apply live
- **Multiple workspaces**: categories, pinned links, Lucide icons for workspaces and links
- **Beautiful UI**: wallpapers and frosted-glass capsules, desktop and mobile
- **Smart sorting**: by usage frequency (default), recent, or custom drag order
- **Quick search**: `/` or `Ctrl/⌘+K`, across all workspaces, web fallback
- **Plugins**: JavaScript plugins add wallpaper sources, dashboard widgets, search providers and scheduled jobs; they run server-side in a sandboxed pure-Go engine ([moejs](https://github.com/MoeForge/moejs)), and your AI can write and install them for you
- **Health checks** and automatic favicons
- **Fast and tiny**: single Go binary, ~11 MB image, ~6 MB RAM
- **Private**: self-hosted, login plus read-only guest mode, no telemetry
- **Easy deploy**: Docker, amd64 / arm64

## Quick start

```bash
docker run -d --name genkan --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 -v genkan-data:/data \
  -e GENKAN_PASSWORD=change-me-please \
  ghcr.io/jae-jae/genkan:latest
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. Without `GENKAN_PASSWORD` you are asked to set an admin password on first visit.

Or with Docker Compose (see [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) for a hardened example):

```yaml
services:
  genkan:
    image: ghcr.io/jae-jae/genkan:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports: ["8080:8080"]
    volumes: ["genkan-data:/data"]
    environment:
      GENKAN_PASSWORD: "change-me-please"   # optional; otherwise set it on first visit
volumes:
  genkan-data:
```

Images are published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon, NAS).

## Plugins

Plugins are single JavaScript (or TypeScript) files that extend Genkan with wallpaper sources, widgets on the board, search providers (a calculator in the search box, say) and scheduled jobs. They run on the server in a sandbox (memory and time limits, no filesystem, network access only to the hosts the plugin declares and you approve) and only return declarative JSON, so the browser never executes plugin code.

Install the built-in examples (calculator, world clock, countdown, weather, RSS, Pi-hole and more) from Settings → Plugins, paste your own source or a URL, or ask your AI assistant to write one with the Skill / MCP tools. The plugin contract is documented in [`docs/PLUGINS.md`](docs/PLUGINS.md) (Chinese).

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GENKAN_ADDR` | `:8080` | Listen address |
| `GENKAN_DATA` | `./data` (`/data` in Docker) | Data directory: `genkan.json` and `uploads/` |
| `GENKAN_PASSWORD` | empty | Sets the admin password on first start (min. 6 chars); never overwrites an existing one |

- Everything lives in the data directory: back it up, or use Settings → Data to export JSON.
- Behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik), forward `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` so cookies get the `Secure` flag.
- Subcommands: `genkan version`, `genkan healthcheck` (used by the Docker `HEALTHCHECK`).

## Development

Requires Go 1.27+ and Node 22+.

```bash
make web      # build the frontend (embedded into the binary)
make build    # static binary -> bin/genkan
make run      # run locally with ./data
make test     # go vet + go test -race
make e2e      # Playwright suite against a throw-away Docker container
```
