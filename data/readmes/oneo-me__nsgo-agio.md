  The agent core of NSGo apps: run coding agents (pi, Codex, Claude Code, CodeBuddy Code) and show their work on phones and desktops, in one process or as a server and its clients.

Agio is two things:

- **A library.** Other NSGo apps build their own development environments on it: drivers for each agent CLI, a host that runs them on macOS, Windows or Linux, a wire protocol to reach them from another process or a phone, and views for phones and desktops, behind one neutral API.
- **An app.** Agio, in `cmd/agio`, is that core in a window of its own, to demonstrate and test it, and a simple tool for working with agents: tasks in projects, agent and model settings, color schemes, notifications and automatic updates.

## Download

Download Agio for macOS, Windows or Linux, on arm64 or x64, from the [latest release](https://github.com/oneo-me/nsgo-agio/releases/latest). It updates itself from GitHub's releases: on macOS and Windows it installs them, and on Linux it opens the release.

Agio runs the agent CLIs on the login shell's `PATH` with your own sign-ins. It sends anonymous usage statistics to Umami: when it is open and used, and which agents messages go to, never prompts or folders. Builds run with `nsgo dev` send nothing, and its settings turn them off.

## Install the library

```sh
go get github.com/oneo-me/nsgo-agio@v0.1.0
```

It needs Go 1.27 and the agent CLIs you want on the login shell's `PATH`; it runs them with your own sign-ins.

## Usage

An application chooses where its agents run by the backend it shows. In one process, a `host.Host` runs them:

```go
h := host.New(host.Options{Dir: workDir})
nsgo.Run(func(cx *core.Scope) core.Node {
	return chatview.App{Model: chatview.Bind(cx, h)}
})
h.Close()
```

As a server and its clients, the server serves its host and a client shows a `wire.Client` instead:

```go
// Server
wire.ListenAndServe(host.New(host.Options{Dir: workDir}), "127.0.0.1:7788", token)

// Client
c, err := wire.Dial("127.0.0.1:7788", token)
nsgo.Run(func(cx *core.Scope) core.Node {
	return chatview.App{Model: chatview.Bind(cx, c)}
})
```

`chatview.Conversation` shows a single conversation for an application with its own layout, and `wire.Serve` serves any byte stream, such as an SSH session. Agents run with full access to the server's files, so keep a server on a private network and give it a token.

Agio runs its agents in one process; the examples run as a server and its client:

| Program | Run |
| --- | --- |
| Agio | `go tool nsgo dev cmd/agio` |
| Server | `go run ./examples/server -token secret` |
| Client | `AGIO_TOKEN=secret go tool nsgo dev examples/client` |

`go tool nsgo build cmd/agio` builds Agio for macOS, Windows and Linux, on arm64 and x64. Releases update themselves from the latest GitHub release when built with `NSGO_UPDATES_KEY`, the secret key of `updates.key` in `cmd/agio/nsgo.yaml`. `go build -tags agiodemo ./cmd/agio` builds a demo that shows scripted tasks instead of running agents, which the website's screenshots use.

Pushing a tag `v<version>` matching `version` in `cmd/agio/nsgo.yaml`, such as `v0.1.0`, publishes that version: the Go module, and a GitHub release of Agio with its `CHANGELOG.md` section as the notes, built with the `NSGO_UPDATES_KEY` repository secret.

## Documentation

[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) maps the packages and the boundaries between them.

## Development

Run `go tool nsgo check` and `go tool nsgo test` from the repository root. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for how changes are made. The website is in [website/](website/README.md).

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.
