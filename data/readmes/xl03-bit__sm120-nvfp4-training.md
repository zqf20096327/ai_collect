# SM120 NVFP4 Training

**A single GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB trained all 4.06B parameters of a language model for 2,048 AdamW updates on FineWeb.** The final training batch had a loss of **6.61997**. On the same 65,536 held-out tokens, validation loss fell from **11.40081 to 6.67528**. PyTorch peak GPU memory was **12.75 GiB allocated** and **14.33 GiB reserved**.

GeForce RTX 50-series and RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs have native FP4 Tensor Cores, but Transformer Engine does not support its full NVFP4 training recipe with stochastic rounding and random Hadamard transforms on SM120. [NVIDIA hardware support matrix](https://nvidia.github.io/TransformerEngine/support_matrix.html)

This project builds on [Infatoshi/nvfp4-sm120](https://github.com/Infatoshi/nvfp4-sm120). It keeps stochastic rounding and the Hadamard transform in software, runs forward and backward matrix multiplies on the FP4 Tensor Cores, and speeds up training by fusing weight-gradient and AdamW updates where the matrix shape allows. Six profiles trade training speed against GPU memory use. The benchmarks below were run on a GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB.

## 4.06B full-parameter run

The model saw 2,097,152 training tokens at batch size 2 and sequence length 512. Each update averaged 297.98 ms (3,436 tokens/s). The run used `experimental_fp8_master`, block-by-block initialization and transpose recomputation. Weights, activations and AdamW state stayed on the GPU.

An earlier run exposed an overflow in the fixed-scale FP8 master weights. Version `0.1.0.dev1` lets each block of 512 weights grow its scale when an update exceeds its range. With the same seed and data, the rerun passed all 19 FP8 weight scans and the final model and optimizer health check.

## Install and verify

Use an existing Linux or WSL Python with the verified dependencies. The tested stack uses Python 3.10, PyTorch 2.11.0+cu130, TorchAO 0.17.0, Triton 3.6.0, NumPy, Ninja, a compatible NVIDIA driver, CUDA Toolkit 13.0 with nvcc and a C++ compiler. If CUDA discovery fails, set `CUDA_HOME` to the local toolkit directory before starting Python. The install command below adds the package while preserving the installed training dependencies.

```bash
python -m pip install --no-deps .
python -m nvfp4_training list
python -m nvfp4_training verify
python -m nvfp4_training check
python examples/train.py --profile balanced
```

`verify` compiles the CUDA extensions and checks quantization against a separately built reference, paired gradients, stochastic-rounding statistics and continuous updates. It records the accepted backward modes in the user's cache. Re-run after a fingerprint or device change. `check` exercises each profile with aligned/padded shapes, eager/graph execution, transpose recomputation and checkpoint recovery. No dataset is needed for these commands.

## Use in a training loop

```python
import torch
from torch import nn
from nvfp4_training import enable_nvfp4, train_step, check_finite

model = enable_nvfp4(nn.Linear(257, 193), profile="balanced")
x = torch.randn(2, 64, 257, device="cuda")
y = torch.randn(2, 64, 193, device="cuda")

def objective(model, x, y):
    return (model(x).float() - y).square().mean()

loss = train_step(model, objective, x, y)
check_finite(model)
```

Start with a fresh trainable FP32 model with ordinary `nn.Linear` layers on one device. The converter attaches the matching AdamW as `model.nvfp4_optimizer`. For fixed shapes, use `with capture_step(model, objective, x, y, steps=N) as graph:` and call `graph.step(next_x, next_y)` once per real update. An eager step can precede capture. After closing the graph, use `save_checkpoint(path, model)` and restore with `load_checkpoint(path, fresh_converted_model)`. Save the sampler position separately. Global gradient clipping, cross-step accumulation, distributed training and custom Linear subclasses need their own integration. The FP8-master profile requires one deferred weight-gradient contribution per compressed projection per backward.

## Measurements on one RTX 5060 Ti

Complete forward, loss, backward and AdamW update, 12 warmup steps and five rounds of 30 synchronized steps. Peak memory is PyTorch allocated GiB, measured from initialization through training. The table uses the original, pre-fix implementation and disables transpose recomputation. Per-round timings and three recomputation variants are in [the results](results/benchmarks.json).

| Profile | Master / moments | 453M, 2×64 ms / GiB | FineWeb 354M, 2×512 ms / GiB |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `balanced` | FP16 / 8+8 bits | 19.23 / 2.049 | 40.08 / 2.562 |
| `short128` | FP16 / 8+8 bits, 128-element blocks | 18.49 / 2.069 | 39.78 / 2.580 |
| `conservative` | BF16 + signed residual / 8+8 bits | 20.30 / 2.487 | 41.82 / 2.865 |
| `same_as_v5` | FP32 / INT8 + block-scaled FP16 | 28.81 / 3.351 | 46.27 / 3.447 |
| `experimental_m4v4` | FP16 / 4+4 bits | 19.20 / 1.687 | 38.84 / 2.266 |
| `experimental_fp8_master` | scaled E4M3 / 4+4 bits | 19.05 / 1.265 | 39.89 / 1.985 |

Only `experimental_fp8_master` uses adaptive blocks of 512 for master-weight storage. `balanced`, `short128` and `experimental_m4v4` store their compressed projection weights in FP16. `conservative` stores a BF16 value plus a signed residual, and `same_as_v5` keeps FP32 master weights. The block scales for AdamW moments and for the NVFP4 matrix operands are separate from the FP8 master-weight scale.

`remat=True` re-encodes the transposed weight during backward. In the 453M workload the FP8-master profile with recomputation measured **18.01 ms and 1.031 GiB**. Tied embedding/output weights stay FP32. Weight packing uses separate 1×16 scales along the two contraction directions. NVIDIA Transformer Engine's default 16×16 shared weight scaling is a different recipe.

```bash
python -m nvfp4_training bench --task 453m --profile short128
python -m nvfp4_training bench --task 453m --profile short128 --precision bf16
# For the language-model benchmark, set NVFP4_FINEWEB to the external shard.
python -m nvfp4_training bench --task fineweb --profile experimental_m4v4 --remat
```

The FineWeb benchmark expects [this GPT-2-tokenized shard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kjj0/fineweb10B-gpt2/blob/889765ea1f903759787add96995d81171b632d0c/fineweb_train_000001.bin), SHA-256 `771fa4a99b9fe0946ffb6e848b4ba5c6a9b0fe87860ebf03bc2c1c7e45f8178e`. It verifies the digest before use.

### Validation loss

At 8,192 steps and 8,388,608 training tokens, validation cross-entropy was **5.85269** for balanced NVFP4, **5.87184** for 4-bit moments and **5.89044** for FP8 master + 4-bit moments. Balanced BF16 reached **5.84488**. The FP8-master BF16 control produced nonfinite training loss after its last finite evaluation at step 6,144. The plot and [paired-window results](results/validation.json) retain that missing endpoint. These are single-seed runs on a 354M causal LM.

### Where the numbers come from

The table and curves come from the saved RTX 5060 Ti runs. The 453M task uses synthetic, GPU-resident inputs, bidirectional attention and MSE. FineWeb uses causal attention, a tied vocabulary head and token cross-entropy. At step 8,192 the balanced FP4–BF16 difference was +0.00781 CE on the same held-out windows. See the [validation and packaging record](results/README.md) for the scope of the checks.

On a new machine, `verify` tests all three backward paths against the reference. It records `fast_pair` for both aligned and padded inputs after the tests pass. This preserves the weight-packing configuration used for the table and long runs.
