```sh
# Two agents: one builds, one reviews with another model
axel agent new atlas --harness claude
axel agent new nova --harness codex --skills review

# A thread: atlas does the work, then hands the diff to nova
axel thread new --agent atlas "add retries to the webhook sender, then ask @nova to review it"
```

Or run `axel` in Rex and type the same thing into the launcher that floats over your window.
The thread keeps going when you close the laptop, and you can pick it up from any machine.

## Key features

### 🧵 Threads, not chat tabs

A thread is an intent and everything done about it. It outlives the agent's process, the
pane and the machine: run several at once, resume tomorrow, settle it when it's done. Every
change is a signed event, so copies on other machines merge.

### 🪪 Named agents

A team of specialists instead of one assistant that knows everything. `atlas` builds with a
few skills for your stack; `nova` reviews with another model. Each has its own Ed25519 key,
permissions, budget and inbox, and loads only its own skills.

```sh
axel agent new nova --harness codex --skills review
axel send "@nova please review the diff"
```

### 🖥️ The terminal, fixed by Rex

Agent apps rebuilt the terminal because it couldn't keep work alive, show who's waiting on
you, reach your other machines, or even scroll. Rex fixes all of that, so Axel is just a
program in a pane: threads stream as plain output and scroll like anything else, and status
shows up in Rex's tabs. [Why Rex →](https://axel.md/docs/why-rex)

### 🤖 Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode

Bring the harness you already use. Axel drives Claude Code and Codex over the Agent Client
Protocol with built-in adapters (no Node), or runs any harness in its own pane. Status comes
from hooks and the protocol, never from scraping a screen.

### 🌐 Your other machines

Your Mac mini on the tailnet is a host. Agents run there, and their keys never leave home:
the host gets a short-lived grant per thread. [Remote hosts →](https://axel.md/docs/remote-hosts)

```sh
axel host add mini
```

### 📜 One AXEL.md for every harness

The project's context and the skills its agents use, in one file that `CLAUDE.md` and
`AGENTS.md` point at. Skills can be local folders or links from skills.sh and GitHub, pinned
in `AXEL.lock`. [The AXEL.md file →](https://axel.md/docs/axel-md)

```yaml
skills:
  - ./skills
  - https://skills.sh/vercel-labs/skills/find-skills
```

### 🛡️ Autopilot, with a guard

Agents work without asking by default. Axel's guard still refuses irreversible commands,
and a budget caps what each agent spends. Want a say? Give an agent a stricter mode.
[Permissions and budgets →](https://axel.md/docs/policies)

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://axel.md/install | sh
```

or with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install scarce/axel/axel
```

Then run `axel` in a Rex terminal. The first run checks your machine and helps you create
your first agent. Every commit on `main` that passes CI is a release, so run the script
again or `brew upgrade` to update.

You'll need [Rex](https://www.superlogical.com/rex) and a harness:
[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex) or
[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). Details in the [installation guide](https://axel.md/docs/installation).
