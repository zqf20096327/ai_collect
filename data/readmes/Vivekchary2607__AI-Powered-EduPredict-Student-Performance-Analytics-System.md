# 📘 AI-powered EduPredict – Student Performance and Analytics System  

## 📌 Introduction  
EduPredict is an AI-powered system designed to analyze student academic and behavioral data to predict performance outcomes such as **Pass/Fail classification, dropout risk, and overall academic trends**. By leveraging **Machine Learning** models, the system provides institutions and educators with **early intervention insights**, helping improve student success rates.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Predict student performance based on academic and behavioral attributes.  
- Identify patterns and risk factors that affect academic success.  
- Provide educators with actionable insights to support struggling students.  
- Develop a user-friendly analytics dashboard for visualization.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 📊 **Performance Prediction** – Predicts student outcomes (pass/fail or grades).  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Models** – Uses classification algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.  
- 🔍 **Analytics Dashboard** – Visualizes trends, failure risk, and subject-wise performance.  
- 📈 **SHAP-based Explainability** – Explains why a prediction was made.  
- 📂 **Custom Dataset Handling** – Works with student academic and behavioral datasets.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- Student academic scores (subject-wise marks, GPA, previous performance).  
- Attendance records.  
- Behavioral attributes (participation, assignments, activities).  
- Target label: **Pass/Fail or Grade classification**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Visualization**: Streamlit (interactive dashboard)  
- **Database**: SQLite / CSV for dataset storage  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
