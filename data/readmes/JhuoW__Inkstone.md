Inkstone is an **AI-powered local Markdown editor** for focused writing, with LLM-based document analysis, scoring, and revision suggestions. Your notes stay as ordinary files on your computer.

## Download

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/JhuoW/Inkstone/releases/latest)**

- **Windows**: run `Inkstone-<version>-windows-x64.exe` to install or upgrade. Choose Inkstone from **Open with** for Markdown files, or use **Tools → Default Markdown app** to open Windows default-app settings. The installer is not code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen may warn the first time; choose **More info → Run anyway**.
- **Linux (x64)**: make the `.AppImage` executable and run it, install the `.deb` on Debian or Ubuntu, or unpack the `.tar.gz`.

From 0.10.0 on, the Windows installation and the AppImage update themselves: Inkstone tells you when a new version is out and downloads and installs it only when you agree.

## Features

- [AI Writing Assistant](docs/AI_ASSISTANT.md): 11 provider choices including local models, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini and DeepSeek; model discovery, document scoring, chat and reviewed revisions in a resizable bottom panel.
- Live Markdown editing, a `/` menu for inserting blocks, and a source mode that preserves selection and undo history.
- Inline formulas, LaTeX math blocks, Mermaid diagrams, and editable tables.
- Persistent code blocks with syntax highlighting and a language picker.
- Local folders, search, autosave and recovery; export to PDF, HTML and images, or to Word and more with Pandoc.
- English and Simplified Chinese interfaces, light and dark themes, and an immersive writing mode.
