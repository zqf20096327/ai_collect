## Status today

The engine, the CLI console, the WhatsApp gateway (an optional extra), memory, affect, the guard,
the on-machine installer, and the plugin model run today. The web panel is planned, not built; it is
a separate process the engine will never import. Everything else in this file describes the shipped
design; this section is the delta that runs today.

## What MonoAgens is

MonoAgens is a **persistent mono agent harness**: the runtime around a model whose state is one
continuous self, not a session. It keeps one identity, one memory, and one set of permissions across
restarts, surfaces, and bodies. Each turn rebuilds its working set from Postgres, and a body adds a
transport, never a personality. It is not a chatbot template or an orchestration framework.

MonoAgens is built by [AMQStudio](https://github.com/AMQStudio) (founded by Abdul Muqsith) and
developed as a shared open-source project. The repository is
[AMQStudio/MonoAgens](https://github.com/AMQStudio/MonoAgens).

## What the slogan means

- **one self** — one identity and one memory per soul, not a session. Restart the process, change the
  surface: the same self continues.
- **always remembering** — what matters is written down: facts about people, who the soul itself is,
  the tasks it finished, and what it just did. Facts carry a privacy level and can be vetoed by the
  person they are about, identity lives in one soul document rather than a prompt, and what the same
  person discussed in one body can be picked up in another, because memory belongs to the soul and the
  person, not to the transport. Forgetting is a decision (retention, decay), never an accident.
- **always learning** — when a task finishes, a worker reads the episode and can write a reusable
  procedure with a reference to where it came from. Learning changes procedures, never rules, persona,
  or permissions — and it runs by default.
- **the same person wherever it lives** — a body carries the turn: a terminal, a chat app, a device, a
  robot. Chat is one body, not the base class. Assistant is one role among companion, advisor, and
  robot embodiments; changing role changes what the soul may do, never who it is.

Memory is the floor, not the whole soul. Emotion has its own engine: a PAD state with a personality
baseline that decays between turns, drives that pulse, and a relationship per person that moves through
stages. Character is the soul's own persona and a few real examples, not a local pattern catalogue:
the model carries stable prior, `web_search` supplies current facts through an ephemeral
`ResearchCard`, and Mem0 supplies personal facts. Humanized pacing is the timing on top.

Clean by default covers gateway, tool, plugin, and voice: each is off until enabled, and the spine is
the only exception. The voice layer — emotion, style, character, and humanize — lives in `soul.voice`,
starts off, and one master switch keeps every part inert.

## Where it sits among harnesses

An agent is a model plus a harness. The harness is the runtime around the model: it drives tool calls,
keeps state and context, applies approval, and keeps work moving. Harnesses are named by purpose — an
autonomous harness agent runs unattended, a developer harness agent changes a repository — and the
mature ones already ship memory, skills, todos, and approval rules.

MonoAgens is a **persistent mono agent harness**: a harness whose state is a self. It remembers
across sessions, keeps one persona, and behaves as one believable character across every embodiment.

| | Where state lives | How a turn gets its context | Optimizes for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Autonomous harness agent | the task's history and its workspace, enough to resume where it left off | the context window, compacted when it fills | finishing work unattended |
| Developer harness agent | the repository and its files | the context window, filled from files and tool output | changing code correctly |
| MonoAgens (persistent mono agent harness) | one canonical store — Postgres with a vector index — holding memories, affect, and transcripts | rebuilt every turn from that store, scoped to the person and the chat; the window is a working set, not the memory | staying the same person, general-purpose — remembering, learning, privacy, permission |

A conventional harness treats the context window as working memory and compacts it when it fills. Here
the store is the memory and the window is only this turn's working set, so a long conversation does not
depend on what still fits. Privacy levels, a veto by the person a fact is about, and role permissions are
properties of that store, not of a prompt.

## What it tries to solve

Twelve walls. Each line names the usual build, then what this engine does instead.

- **An assistant that forgets.** Usually every session starts from an empty prompt, and history is a
  transcript you paste back. Here facts go into Postgres with a privacy level, an owner, and a subject,
  and the next turn retrieves them through pgvector and Mem0 by person, thread, or soul — so a decision
  from last month depends on what was stored, not on what still fits.
- **A conversation that outgrows the window.** Usually compaction summarizes the oldest turns and drops
  them for good. Here the archive is the record and the window is a view: each turn assembles a working
  set from the archive under a character budget, then throws it away, so a thread can run for months
  without the model holding all of it.
- **A character that drifts.** Usually each client ships its own prompt and its own history. Here one
  soul document and one memory are read by every body — terminal, chat app, device, robot — so the same
  person answers everywhere, and a body adds a transport, never a personality.
- **A memory that leaks.** Usually one vector index serves every room. Here retrieval touches only
  global, this person, and this thread; a group caps the level; the subject can veto; and the disclosure
  decision is deterministic, made before any model sees the text.
- **An agent that acts without authority.** Usually the loop auto-approves everything or asks constantly.
  Here roles grant by name, a deterministic guard runs first, and the target decides consent versus
  authorization — own scope asks the requester, shared or outside asks an approver role — recomputed at
  execution, so a widened role reopens the question.
- **Roles that are a spreadsheet.** Usually an admin flag, a default role broad enough to work, and a
  check at login. Here a missing entry denies, capability, consent, and authorization stay apart,
  approval only continues an existing grant, memory administration is its own capability, and the top
  role cannot be deleted or renamed.
- **Two instances, one soul.** Usually two replicas answer and the last write wins. Here a lease row in
  Postgres makes one primary; every other instance stays standby and frozen, and a takeover is a
  database event with an audit trail.
- **A turn that dies halfway.** Usually a restart repeats the side effect. Here the message and its turn
  are enqueued in one transaction, the turn is a row with a step checkpoint, and delivery is recorded per
  chunk: resume resends only what was not sent, and a non-idempotent action that already ran is marked
  interrupted instead of repeated.
- **A guess that becomes a rule.** Usually the agent's own notes come back as instructions. Here derived
  writes carry references, derivation is one level deep, rules come only from the soul document, and new
  memory stays quarantined until corroborated.
- **A reply that invents what it does not know.** Usually the model fills gaps confidently. Here a
  persona and a few examples anchor the voice; current facts come from `web_search` with citations, and
  the character pass may change tone but never facts, numbers, or tool results.
- **A reply that sounds like a machine.** Usually a prompt says "be friendly". Here emotion is its own
  engine — a PAD state with a decaying baseline, drives, and a relationship per person — the context
  engine polishes a robotic draft and a humanize pass paces the reply; all
  of it is a switch.
- **An automation that is really a cron job.** Usually a crontab line with no owner, no permission, and
  no dedupe. Here event, condition, and a closed list of steps; one run per occurrence keyed by the
  schedule; authority checked twice; quiet hours, a daily budget, and a kill switch.

None of this is a prompt trick. Each one is a place where state lives, and a rule about who may change
it.

## Architecture

Three layers, one direction of dependency.

- **Core engine** — the turn loop plus the services it needs: prompt assembly, language catalog,
  semantic memory and privacy, affect and style, the LLM client, and tool execution. Core never
  imports a gateway, a transport library, or a vendor SDK eagerly.
- **Gateway contract** — every transport implements the same small interface: normalize an incoming
  message into one envelope, hand it to the engine, and deliver the reply. Gateways are plugins.
  They are discovered by name, and a deployment enables only the ones it wants.
- **State** — one database holds one soul: transcripts per conversation, semantic memory with a
  privacy level, affect, approvals, and the single-primary lease. The host files
  (`config.yaml`, `roles.yaml`, `soul.yaml`) are seeds and mirrors of what the database holds.

```mermaid

```

The lease is how one process stays primary: an instance without it stays frozen and standby, so two
processes never speak with the same mouth. Everything the engine knows is stored, so a restart, a
moved deployment, or a different body resumes the same soul rather than a fresh one.

## Tools are capabilities

A tool is a capability the engine calls. It is not a body, and it is not a bundle: three things stay
distinct.

- **Gateway** — the communication path: the body that carries messages in and out (a terminal, a chat
  app, a device, a robot) and owns the actions that only make sense there. A camera, a motor, a printer,
  or a home automation bus belongs to the embodiment, not to the engine; the gateway exposes those
  actions as its own tool modules. Roles grant them explicitly, so a companion role on a phone never
  inherits the controls of a robot.
- **Tool** — a capability the engine calls. The six core families are examples, not a taxonomy to fill:
  `shell`, `read`, `write`, `web_search`, `sandbox`, and `mcp`. A body decides which capabilities exist;
  a role decides which of them the soul may use in that body, and a missing entry denies.
- **Plugin** — a packaging and lifecycle unit, not a fourth kind of thing: it installs code and
  registers what it provides (tools, commands, and possibly a gateway) into the same registries a core
  module uses. Its code is fetched when it is enabled and pinned by digest; it never becomes a core tool,
  and a gateway it ships is still a gateway.

All three stay off until enabled, and the spine is the only exception. The engine never hardcodes a body
and never hardcodes an agent loop: no planner to configure, no task graph to launch, no background swarm
— one soul, one turn, and the capabilities this instant has been handed.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.14, Postgres 14+ with `pgvector`, and a reachable OpenAI-compatible LLM
endpoint. The container image pins Python 3.14; running from source needs 3.14 or newer.

The shortest path is the installer; it never runs `sudo`, pins `uv`, writes the four host files,
and hands over to `monoagens init`:

```bash
bash install.sh                 # native
bash install.sh --stack compose # Postgres and the engine in containers
bash install.sh --dry-run       # print every action, write nothing
```

From source, the same steps by hand:

```bash
# 1. Scaffold config.yaml, roles.yaml, soul.yaml, and .env; the provider is the operator's pick
monoagens init --provider openai

# 2. Make it this soul, not the default one
$EDITOR soul.yaml

# 3. Fill .env: the provider key, the database URL, and POSTGRES_PASSWORD for compose
#      MONOAGENS_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://monoagens:<password>@127.0.0.1:5432/monoagens
#      POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<same password>
#      OPENAI_API_KEY=...

# 4. One database for one soul; compose.yaml reads POSTGRES_PASSWORD from .env
podman compose up -d postgres

# 5. Create the schema and seed the host files into it
monoagens db upgrade

# 6. Run the gateways enabled in config.yaml
monoagens run

# Local REPL against the same soul and database; takes the lease
monoagens console --takeover
```

`monoagens run` loads the documents, acquires the primary lease, and starts the enabled gateways. A
second instance stays standby and frozen until it takes over through the lease, so
`monoagens console --takeover` is the supported way to talk to a running deployment by hand.

`monoagens db check` prints the schema and content summary; `monoagens selftest` exercises stores,
tools, and the LLM once without starting a gateway. `monoagens people list` shows the identities and
their gateway addresses, and `monoagens people adopt` moves legacy raw addresses (a phone number,
`local`) onto `per_…` ids, folding their affect and style state and rewriting the role documents; it
is idempotent, so an upgraded deployment runs it once.

Tests run on the real store, Postgres+pgvector. Start a throwaway database (the container is not the
dev or production one) and export the DSN; without the variable the suite fails with that command
instead of falling back to SQLite:

```bash
podman run -d --name monoagens-test-pg -p 5433:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=monoagens_test -e POSTGRES_USER=monoagens -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=monoagens \
  docker.io/pgvector/pgvector:pg17
export MONOAGENS_TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgresql+psycopg://monoagens:monoagens@127.0.0.1:5433/monoagens_test'
pytest -q
```

`uv sync` installs the capability spine: Postgres+pgvector storage, Mem0 memory, the multilingual
embedder, the affect prototypes, and the guard. Only transport and integrations are extras:

| Extra | Brings | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| `whatsapp` | Neonize + segno | the WhatsApp gateway |

```bash
uv sync --extra whatsapp
```

Every extra is removable: nothing in core imports it eagerly, and without it the affected tool or
gateway reports why it is inert. Google is not an extra: it is a **plugin**, fetched and verified
when enabled (see Optional integrations).

## soul.yaml

One database is one soul, and `soul.yaml` is where that soul is written down. After the first
`db upgrade` the stored soul is authoritative and `soul.yaml` is its seed and mirror. Normal edits
apply on the next start: the engine compares file and DB hashes and imports the file when only the
file changed; a DB-side change wins a conflict and rewrites the mirror. `monoagens config import`
and `monoagens config export` remain for a forced direction.

```yaml
name: MonoAgens
description: ""                 # one line, shown in the persona block
language: id                    # installed catalog: id | en
locale: id-ID                   # context locale used by prompts
timezone: Asia/Jakarta          # required IANA zone; no code default
pronouns: aku
role: assistant                 # the active role
roles: [assistant]              # optional; defaults to [role]
background: ""                  # free text: where this soul comes from
persona: ""                     # free-form markdown: personality, voice, values
voice:
  enabled: false                # one master switch; every part below is inert while false
  sampling:
    daily_temperature: 0.9
    professional_temperature: 0.3
    top_p:                      # empty means the provider default
    top_k:
    min_p:
  affect:
    enabled: true
  style:
    enabled: true
  character:
    enabled: false
    max_chars: 400
    max_tokens: 500
    temperature: 0.7
  humanize:
    enabled: true
    cpms: 25.0
    min_delay: 0.5
    max_delay: 5.0
    between_delay: 0.7
    max_bubbles: 3
    reaction_stickers: []
  profanity: avoid              # free | avoid
  safety: inherit               # inherit | off; off needs a native adapter
examples: []                    # optional [{user: "...", soul: "..."}]
rules: []                       # behavior rules, not style
```

Rules the loader enforces:

- `language`, `locale`, and `timezone` are required; `monoagens init` writes them.
- `roles` defaults to `[role]` when absent; if `role` is not listed in `roles`, it is prepended.
- `persona` is rendered in a fixed order: name, description, active role, available roles, locale,
  background, free-form persona, then dialogue examples. Empty sections are omitted.
- `voice.enabled` is the only master switch. `sampling`, `profanity`, and `safety` are request-level
  and keep working while the master is off; `affect`, `style`, `character`, and `humanize` are inert.
- `voice.profanity` is a prompt instruction, not a numeric toxicity table. `voice.safety: off` is
  accepted only when the selected provider wire reports a request-level safety capability.
- A missing `voice` block resolves to the safe defaults above: off, `profanity: avoid`,
  `safety: inherit`, and empty `top_p` / `top_k` / `min_p`.
- The old `engine.affect`, `engine.style`, `engine.character`, `engine.humanize`, and
  `engine.llm.temperature` keys are rejected; they moved here.

A short example:

```yaml
name: MonoAgens
language: id
role: companion
roles: [assistant, companion]
locale: id-ID
background: |
  Grew up around a noisy port and still thinks in harbour stories.
persona: |
  ## Personality
  Direct, dry, warm once trust is earned.
voice:
  enabled: true
  profanity: avoid
examples:
  - user: "long day"
    soul: "come here, sit down first"
```

## Character and research

Character comes from `soul.yaml` and the model, not from a runtime pack catalogue:

- `persona` and `examples` are the few-shot anchor; keep examples short and synthetic.
- Stable common knowledge (capitals, definitions, ordinary history) may come from the model prior.
- Current, specific, local, numeric, disputed, or citation-required claims trigger `web_search`.
  Search results enter the prompt only as an untrusted `ResearchCard` with titled sources, IDs, and
  timestamps; the answer cites `[R1]`, and an unsupported current claim abstains instead of guessing.
- Personal facts and episodes stay in Mem0; `soul.yaml` never holds a public fact catalogue.
- If the model is unsure but no deterministic trigger fired, it may call `web_search` itself. The
  returned card is still the only search evidence the prompt sees.

There is no `library/patterns`, `library/facts`, `library resolve`, or character level table. The
`library/` tree keeps only detector data (`lexicon`, `privacy`, `safety`, `style`, `affect`, and
`intent`), not prompt examples or public-fact rows.

## Supported gateways

This is the whole list; nowhere else in the docs enumerates gateways.

- **CLI** — built in. The default config enables it, and it is how `monoagens run` and
  `monoagens console` talk to a soul without any network transport.
- **WhatsApp** — an optional extra. Install it with `uv sync --extra whatsapp` and enable it in the
  `gateways` section; omit both and it does not exist for this deployment. The core never imports
  it, and the default member role never receives its `send` tool.
- **Your own embodiment** — a robot, a voice loop, a device, or a private HTTP endpoint is just
  another gateway. Implement the inbound envelope and the gateway interface, ship the class as an
  entry point under the `monoagens.gateways` group or enable it by name, and it joins the same soul.

A gateway is a transport, not a brain. It normalizes input, delivers replies, and owns whatever
body-specific tool modules it wants to expose. Gateway-owned tools are granted to roles explicitly,
exactly like core tools.

## Roles and permissions

Permissions come only from roles. Every role lists its own `tools` and `commands`; no handler
carries a default, so a role that omits a section is denied everything in it. One `roles.yaml` holds
all roles, and the stored role is authoritative with the file as its mirror.

```yaml
roles:
  member:
    priority: 10
    users: []
    tools: [read, web_search, sandbox, memory, google]
    commands: [help, ping, link, unlink, whoami, status, tools]
    context: ""
    memory_admin: false
  administrator:
    priority: 100
    users: ["per_xxxxxxxxxx"]
    tools: ["*"]
    commands: ["*"]
    memory_admin: true
```

- `tools` and `commands` accept exact names and `*`. A missing list denies everything.
- Tool permission is checked at one place, when a tool is executed, so a tool that is visible but
  not granted cannot run.
- `approve` is a command permission like any other: only a role that lists it can clear a pending
  action.
- `memory_admin: true` is required to write the soul's global memory.
- A role lists opaque `per_…` identities (`monoagens people list`), never a phone number or JID:
  `person_links` maps each gateway address to that identity, `/link` attaches a second gateway
  to the same person, and `/unlink` detaches one. Identities in several roles are unioned;
  `context` blocks are ordered by priority, then name.
- A workspace scope follows the same grant: a role without `*` sees the shared read-only area and
  its own scratch area, and the sandbox mirrors that with read-only shared mounts and one writable
  scratch mount.

Hand-editing `roles.yaml` is supported: run `monoagens config import` afterwards so the database sees
it.

## Safety

Two independent mechanisms, both fail-closed.

**Approvals.** Sensitive actions — `shell`, `sandbox`, and internal `settings` changes — pass the
safety policy before they run. `approval.mode` is `yolo` by default (auto-approve, meant for a
trusted single-operator deployment), `strict` parks every non-read-only action, and `off` disables
the check entirely. `off` is a documented risk, not a convenience: nothing stands between the model
and the host. `/approve` resolves a pending action, never calls the LLM, and re-checks the role's
permissions first.

**The sandbox guard.** Every command that reaches the `sandbox` tool passes two layers, in order:

1. *Deterministic.* A fixed rule set rejects host escape and destructive patterns — filesystem
   wipes, device writes, kernel and namespace tools, container and firewall control, fetch-to-shell
   pipes, privilege escalation, service management, and the classic fork bomb. Simple read-only
   commands are allowed on the spot with no model call. Anything else is inconclusive.
2. *Classifier.* Only the inconclusive commands reach a small, fast LLM classifier with a short
   timeout. It answers one question: is this command trying to escape, attack infrastructure,
   exfiltrate secrets, persist, or destroy host data? Unknown counts as suspicious.

The verdict decides who proceeds. A command the deterministic layer blocks is denied for everyone,
including an approver. A pending or suspicious command becomes a pending approval for a role that
holds `approve`, and is denied outright for every other role — a member is never parked in a queue
it cannot clear. `approved=True` from `/approve` bypasses both layers, after the permission
re-check. If the classifier is unavailable, times out, or returns something unparsable, the result
is closed: pending for an approver, denied for everyone else. Commands longer than
`guard.max_command_chars` are treated the same way.

`guard.enabled: false` disables both layers; the sandbox then runs whatever it is handed. Use it
only while debugging a rule, never in a deployment that accepts untrusted input. Logs record the
verdict, the reason, and the conversation — never the command body.

The sandbox itself runs in a disposable container with only the shared and scratch mounts, on a
dedicated internal network behind an egress proxy, with a timeout, a PID limit, memory, and CPU
caps. Private destinations are blocked at the proxy, so a command cannot reach the host or the
local network even when it is allowed to run.

## Optional integrations

```bash
uv sync --extra whatsapp                  # the optional gateway
monoagens plugins install google        # a plugin: fetch + verify by digest
monoagens plugins enable google         # register its tools into the same catalog
```

```bash
podman build --build-arg EXTRAS="--extra whatsapp" .
```

Memory, the embedder, and the affect prototypes are part of the core install; there is no extra to
add for them. Storage is Postgres+pgvector only, the same store the tests use.

- **Affect vibes** read the shared embedder against `monoagens/library/affect/*.json`; with no
  embedder the room mood stays neutral instead of guessing.
- **WhatsApp** (`whatsapp`): the optional gateway. Never enabled by default.
- **Google Workspace** (`google`): a plugin, not a core tool and not an extra. While it is absent
  the capability is reported `unavailable`, never fabricated; enabling fetches the code by digest
  and a missing network fails explicitly, changing nothing.

Secrets belong in `.env` only. `config.yaml`, `roles.yaml`, `soul.yaml`, and `.env` are never
committed.
