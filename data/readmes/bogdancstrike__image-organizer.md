# Auto Image Organizer

**Turn a messy photo folder into beautifully organized albums. Locally, in seconds, with an undo button.**

Sort by what's *in* the photos, cull a shoot like a pro (blurry · eyes closed · best of burst),
and watch every thumbnail fly into its folder.

## ✨ Why

Your *Downloads*, your phone dump, last weekend's shoot: thousands of files called `IMG_4821.JPG`.
**Auto Image Organizer** looks at every photo and video, understands what it shows, and proposes a clean folder
structure. Nothing moves until you press **Apply**, and every apply can be **undone**.

- 🧭 **Tells you what to do.** It looks at a sample of the folder and recommends a recipe ("Looks like *Trash the dress*, 96% sure → *A wedding*"). One click, then Sort.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **By person.** Face recognition (YuNet + SFace, on-device) puts every person in their own folder; rename *Person 1* to *Laura*.
- 📊 **Statistics tab:** total processing time, time per sort and per phase, files processed, photos organized, AI tokens.
- 💾 **Everything in SQLite** (`data/app.db`): category sets (seeded with AI hints on first start), History, settings, statistics.
- 🌍 **5 languages:** English, Română, Español, Deutsch, Français.
- 🧠 **Understands content.** CLIP sorts *outfits*, *mountains*, *studio light*, *food & cafés*, *screenshots* … no tags needed.
- 📸 **Built for photographers.** Culling with blur, eyes-closed and exposure checks, best-of-burst, stars, and RAW + JPEG pairs.
- 🔒 **Private by default.** Everything runs on your machine. AI is an optional, token-frugal helper.
- ↩️ **Safe.** You get a plan, then Apply, and a journal records every move, so Undo restores every file.
- 🎞️ **Delightful.** A pile of polaroids flies into folder cards. Three themes: **Graphite** (default), Light and Lavender.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bogdancstrike/image-organizer.git && cd image-organizer
cp .env.example .env            # optional: OPENAI_API_KEY, LIBRARY_PATH …
docker compose up -d --build    # first build bundles the models (~3 min)
```

Open **http://localhost:8080**, click the folder name in *"Sorting my **…** folder"*, pick a folder, and press **Sort**.

> 💡 No photos at hand? `./scripts/download-samples.sh` (landscapes, duplicates, clips) and
> `python3 scripts/download-portraits.py` (200 openly licensed portraits & outfits) fill `./sample-library/`.

## 🧩 Features

### 🔎 Library: find anything
- **Natural-language search:** “red dress at the beach”, “dog in the snow”. Uses the embeddings every sort already computed, plus text inside photos (OCR). ~20 ms per query.
- **Find similar:** open any photo → every look-alike in the folder.
- **Trips & map:** GPS + dates → trips, and a map of where your photos were taken (place names offline, tiles © OpenStreetMap).

### Organize any way you like

| Mode | What you get | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| **Preset** | 15 ready-made, **editable** folder sets | Instant results |
| **My categories** | Your own folders, each described in a few words (and *Photos-only / Videos-only*) | Your Instagram system, client workflows |
| **Auto-discover** | Groups found automatically, named by **what makes them different** inside your folder | Unknown dumps, a studio shoot, a wedding |
| **AI prompt rules** | Describe subjects and destinations, e.g. “landscapes → landscapes/{date}; everything else → others/{date}”; AI proposes a validated plan | Personal filing rules (requires OpenAI key) |
| **By date** | `2025/07 - July` from EXIF / video metadata | Archives |
| **By person** | One folder per recognized person + Groups, Other people, No people. Clear faces anchor identities; pose fragments are consolidated using cluster evidence. Partial faces and faceless views use a shoot-local appearance classifier, multiple face-confirmed references and agreeing nearby frames; conflicting evidence stays in Other people. Group photos: main face only, or a copy for every person. Or **upload a face** and move only that person's photos | Families, events, model shoots |
| **By trip** | Trips from GPS + dates, named like *Rome · May 2025*, plus *Everyday* | Phone camera rolls, travel |
| **By place** | One folder per country or city (offline reverse geocoding) | Travel archives |
| **Social Media** | Cull with local learned visual appeal, thumbnail clarity, crop suitability and visual variety; adjustable formats and influence | Creators |
| **Cull** | Picks ★ · Keepers · Smiling · Maybe · Blurry · Eyes closed · Too dark/bright · Noisy · Burst extras | Photographers |

**Presets:** Lifestyle · People & Style · Boudoir & glamour · Boudoir session (poses & light) · Photoshoot themes (wedding, halloween, moto, pool, studio …) · Wedding day ·
Instagram creator · Travel · Creator · Family & kids · Events · Real estate · Nature & wildlife · Food & product · Documents.
Every preset can be edited from **/categories** and reset to its default.

**Auto-discover understands context.** It detects what the folder *is* (e.g. *Trash the dress · mountains*), lets you choose
**what to group by** (scene, framing & pose, outfit, lighting, subject) and **how finely** (coarse / normal / fine), then names
groups like *Full-body · Golden hour* or *Close-up · Low-key*, not "Wedding" fifteen times.

### 📸 For photographers: culling

| Check | How |
|---|---|
| **Blurry / missed focus** | Laplacian sharpness measured **on faces** when present (bokeh is fine), else on the sharpest tile |
| **Eyes closed** | MediaPipe Face Landmarker blendshapes, on **any face** or only the **main subject** |
| **Smiles** | Smile score per face; *Smiling* gets its own folder |
| **Exposure** | Too dark / too bright, with adjustable thresholds |
| **Best of burst** | Near-identical frames shot seconds apart: keep the best, set the rest aside |
| **Score & stars** | Genre-aware recommendations combine technical quality, expression, composition, light and presentation; the same score drives stars, *Maybe* thresholds and XMP ratings |
| **Noise · tilted horizon · face cut off** | Opt-in checks: Immerkær noise estimate, consistent horizon lines (beta), faces touching the frame |
| **Picks ★** | At least 4.5/5 by default; Keepers are 4.0–under 4.5/5. Both thresholds are adjustable in Quick settings. High-rated near-duplicates go to Similar alternatives. Portrait, fashion/modeling, landscape and general profiles; Auto detects the likely genre locally |
| **Best of similar** | Like best-of-burst, but for near-identical shots taken at any time |
| **Lightroom / Capture One** | On Apply, write `.xmp` sidecars with ★ ratings and color labels (picks Green, rejects Red); removed on Undo |
| **RAW workflow** | `.ARW .CR2 .CR3 .NEF .DNG .RAF …` read through the embedded preview; **RAW + JPEG pairs and `.xmp` sidecars move together** |

**Why these picks?** Open a photo for an attached score panel: recommendations, component scores,
quality flags, tags and decision evidence. A **Winner photo** badge identifies one best recommendation
per Cull; the file keeps its ordinary folder assignment. Duplicate/trash reasons identify the kept
file, and manual overrides retain the original suggestion. Review sorts by recommendation score and has a **Top picks** filter.
Multiscale detail, edge balance and subject/background separation add pixel-level evidence. Folder grids sort by
score descending by default; switch to ascending from the folder’s score control. Group photos consider
important faces together, or your selected main subject. Fashion poses need not smile or look straight at the camera.
Low-key images are not penalized simply for being dark. Picks are recommendations for your review, not an objective
beauty score. Read the [research and scoring policy](docs/culling-research.md) and [31-method implementation checklist](docs/culling-algorithms.md).

**LAION visual appeal:** Social Media includes an optional, bundled [LAION aesthetic predictor](https://github.com/LAION-AI/aesthetic-predictor)
(MIT license). Enable **Learned visual appeal · LAION** under **Settings → Social Media** or Quick settings.
The small model runs offline with NumPy on CPU, using the bundled CLIP encoder, and exposes a separate
score component. CLIP jobs reuse existing vectors; SigLIP jobs evaluate every nonduplicate photo using separately cached CLIP vectors. It estimates subjective visual appeal and contributes to the adjustable social
blend; it does not predict likes. See [model provenance and limitations](backend/app/infrastructure/models/laion_aesthetic/README.md).

**Review faster:** compare 2–4 photos side by side at Fit, 100% or 200%, synchronize pan, inspect face crops, and
override destinations. Close-burst, Unique views and Alternative strengths filters surface decisions worth checking.
Quick settings has collapsible categories; folder ordering uses a compact score toolbar. Hover or focus badges to
read their meaning.

**Searchable automatic tags:** local CLIP/SigLIP tags cover subjects, scenes, outfits, activities, lighting and framing.
Tags are visible in photo details and search results. Library supports exact tag filters (all selected tags must match),
semantic queries and OCR matches. Use **Update search tags** to backfill an existing index; no Apply is needed. Tags and
embeddings remain searchable after Apply and Undo. Automatic labels are suggestions, not verified object annotations.

Use **Cull** on its own, or switch on *quality checks* with any other mode to set rejects aside in `_Rejects/<reason>`.

### Safe by design
- **Plan → Review → Apply → Undo.** Review the plan in a sortable, filterable table, open any photo full-size, and **reassign** files (or a whole selection) before applying.
- Move **or** copy. Collisions become `name (1).jpg`, and a journal makes undo work even after a restart.
- Duplicates (byte-identical **and** resized or re-saved copies): **set aside** in `_Duplicates`, put **next to the original**,
  or **left in place**. New duplicate plans never send files to trash; legacy runs retain previews and Undo.
  Choose which copy counts as the original: best quality, oldest or newest.

### Fast & frugal
- CLIP ViT-B/32 on **ONNX/CPU**: about 100 photos in about 5 s on first run, and **re-runs are instant** thanks to the analysis cache.
- Videos: keyframe-only decoding at 336 px with sampled hashing, so a 60 s 1080p clip takes **0.3 s**. Photos are analyzed first.
- 40+ formats: JPEG, PNG, HEIC/HEIF, AVIF, **JPEG XL**, WebP, TIFF, PSD, JPEG 2000, camera RAW · MP4, MOV, MKV, MTS/M2TS, AVI, WMV, …

### More engines
- **SigLIP 2** as an alternative recognition model (Settings → Organizing): more accurate on scenes and styles, ~3× slower on the first run.
- **OCR** (RapidOCR): reads text in photos; text-heavy ones go to documents / captions folders, and the text is **searchable** in Review.

### 🤖 AI is optional
The local sorting modes work offline without a key. **AI prompt rules require a key** and send instructions plus thumbnails for all non-duplicate files; other AI features remain optional. With `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the app uses **`gpt-6-luna`** (`reasoning: low`):
- **Auto naming:** *one* request per sort (small contact sheets at `detail: low`), measured at **about 1k tokens and 4–6 s**.
  On a mountain wedding shoot it answered *"Mountain Wedding"* with groups like *Mountain Vistas*, *Monochrome Veils*, *Portraits & Details*.
- **AI assist** (opt-in): only *uncertain* files (cheap) **or every photo** (most accurate), 12 low-detail thumbnails per request.
- **Editable prompts:** the naming and assist prompts are shown pre-filled; tweak them or reset. Each folder can carry its own
  **AI hint** ("only if a motorcycle is clearly visible"); folders without one are described by their CLIP descriptions.
- Model (any vision model on your key) and reasoning effort are switchable per run in **Settings → AI**.

### Sort with instructions

Choose **AI rules** in Quick settings and describe the destinations, for example:

```text
Put landscape photos into landscapes/{date}.
Put food photos into food/{year}/{month}.
Everything else goes into others/{date}.
```

AI reads the instructions once, then matches thumbnails in batches using the selected OpenAI model.
Dates use the server's date when the sort starts: `{date}`/`{today}` = `DD.MM.YYYY`, `{iso}` = `YYYY-MM-DD`.
Paths are relative to your output folder, and no Photos/Videos prefix is inserted. Earlier matching rules win;
an explicit “everything else” rule handles unmatched files, otherwise they go to Unsorted. Duplicate and enabled
quality-check policies still apply. Unsafe paths, unavailable AI and malformed responses fail visibly without
applying a partial plan. Review destinations before Apply; Undo works as with other modes.

<img src="docs/assets/diagram-architecture.png" alt="Architecture" width="100%" />

One container: **FastAPI** runs a background pipeline (scan → analyze → quality → dedupe → categorize → plan) and streams
progress to the **React** UI over Server-Sent Events. A canvas engine animates every file from the pile into its folder card.

## ⚡ Performance & hardware

Measured with [`scripts/benchmark.py`](scripts/benchmark.py) on the bundled Docker image
(AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D, 16 cores / 32 threads, 64 GB RAM, NVMe, **CPU only, no GPU**). *Plan only: nothing was moved.*

| Workload | Files | Cold (first run) | Warm (cached) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lifestyle preset · mixed downloads incl. 3 videos | 115 | **2.2 s** (51 files/s) | 0.04 s |
| People & Style preset · portraits | 199 | **2.1 s** (96 files/s) | 0.04 s |
| Lifestyle preset · scale test | 995 | **8.4 s** (119 files/s) | 0.2 s |
| Cull · 24 MP wedding JPEGs (faces, blur, exposure) | 30 | **2.1 s** | 0.01 s |
| Cull · scale test (faces, blur, bursts) | 995 | **10.4 s** (95 files/s) | 0.2 s |
| Auto-discover + AI naming (`gpt-6-luna`, 1 call) | 30–199 | **4–6 s** (dominated by the API call) | same |
| Video: 60 s 1080p clip (3 keyframes + hash) | 1 | **0.3 s** | – |

**New engines on a real 1,029-photo boudoir folder** (24 MP JPEGs):

| Run | Wall time | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CLIP preset, cold | 26.9 s | 55 duplicates found |
| SigLIP 2 preset, cold / warm | 57.4 s / 0.2 s | 768-d embeddings, separate cache |
| By person (YuNet + SFace), cold | 36.6 s | 7+ people found, avatars per person |
| Cull (faces, blur, exposure, bursts), cold | 43.3 s | |
| OCR · 115 mixed downloads, cold | 13.7 s | |
| Whole sample library (1,800 files), warm | 0.5 s | analysis cache |

**With AI** (`gpt-6-luna`, `reasoning: low`, 12 thumbnails per request at `detail: low`, 6 requests in parallel; analysis cached):

| Run | Files | Wall time | Requests | Tokens in / out | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lifestyle preset + AI on **every** photo | 115 | 15.4 s | 10 | 5.8k / 3.9k | 101 placed by AI, 4 unsorted |
| People & Style preset + AI on **every** photo | 199 | 21.7 s | 17 | 10.3k / 8.1k | 192 placed by AI, 0 unsorted |
| People & Style preset + AI on **unsure** photos only | 199 | 6.6 s | 1 | 0.6k / 0.5k | 12 placed by AI, 0 unsorted |
| Auto-discover + AI naming | 199 | 5.1 s | 1 | 1.0k / 0.3k | collection + group names |

Rule of thumb: AI on every photo costs **≈ 50 input + 40 output tokens per photo** and adds about **0.1 s per photo**.
Unsure-only usually needs a single request.

- **Memory:** about 50 MB idle; **about 2.2 GB peak** while culling 1,000 photos (CLIP + MediaPipe + 8 workers).
- **Disk:** image ≈ 2.1 GB (models included, works offline). Cache ≈ **12 KB per photo** (WebP thumbnail + analysis), so 100k photos take about 1.2 GB in `./data`.
- **Re-runs are near-instant:** analysis is cached by path + size + mtime, so changing presets, thresholds or the strategy never re-reads your photos.

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | 4 cores (x86_64) | 8+ cores |
| RAM | 4 GB | 8 GB+ |
| Disk | 3 GB + ~12 KB / photo | SSD |
| GPU | not needed (CPU default) | optional NVIDIA GPU with `DEVICE=gpu` |
| Software | Docker + Compose v2 | – |

Rough throughput scales with cores: expect about **30–60 photos/s on a 4-core laptop** for the first run. Tune `WORKERS` (default `min(8, CPUs)`).
Benchmark your own machine: `python3 scripts/benchmark.py --source "Pictures/Trip" --strategy cull`.

### Optional GPU acceleration

CPU is the default. For NVIDIA acceleration, set `DEVICE=gpu` in `.env` and run `docker compose up -d --build`.
The same Compose command selects the GPU image and reserves one GPU. The host needs an NVIDIA driver and
NVIDIA Container Toolkit. CLIP and SigLIP 2 embeddings run on CUDA; decoding, quality checks, faces, OCR and
clustering stay on CPU. Switch back with `DEVICE=cpu`. See [GPU configuration](docs/configuration.md#cpu-or-nvidia-gpu).

## 🐳 Deployment

```bash
docker compose up -d --build        # start / update
docker compose logs -f              # logs
docker compose run --rm organizer pytest -q   # tests inside the image
```

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `LIBRARY_PATH` | `$HOME` | Host folder the app may browse & organize (mounted read-write at `/library`) |
| `PORT` | `8080` | Web UI / API port |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | `1000` | Files are moved as this user |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | – | Optional AI naming & assist |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-6-luna` | Any vision-capable model on the Responses API (switchable per run in Settings → AI) |
| `WORKERS` | `min(8, CPUs)` | Analysis threads |
| `OUTPUT_DIR_NAME` | `Organized` | Default subfolder for sorted folders (changeable per run) |

> ⚠️ The app has **no login** and can move files under `LIBRARY_PATH`. Keep it on `localhost` or behind your own
> authenticating reverse proxy, and narrow `LIBRARY_PATH` (e.g. `~/Pictures`) if you prefer.
