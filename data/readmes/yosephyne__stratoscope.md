Stratoscope shows what your local LLM inference engine is doing right now, in the macOS menu bar or the Windows taskbar.

- The speed, like `247 t/s`, and a progress bar while a prompt is read. The bar's color shows how much came from the cache.
- The panel: the current request, the context and how its size changed over the last 12 requests, the speed of the last 12 requests, RAM / GPU / CPU, the cache slots, and totals.
**Cache colors**

| Color | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Green | 90 % or more of the prompt came from the cache |
| Yellow | Less than 90 %, but at least 8,192 tokens were reused |
| Orange | Less than 8,192 tokens reused. Expect a wait |
| Gray | Prompt under 4,096 tokens. Too small to matter |

## Install

### With your agent (recommended)

Give this prompt to an AI agent that runs on your computer and knows your local LLM setup, or can read its configs:

```text
Install Stratoscope on this computer and set it up for my local LLM.

1. Check whether this is macOS or Windows.
2. Download the latest release from
   https://github.com/yosephyne/stratoscope/releases/latest and check its sha256
   against the digest shown there. macOS: Stratoscope-<version>-macos.dmg; open
   it, copy Stratoscope to Applications, start it. If macOS warns that the app is
   not notarized, tell me and wait, and change no security settings. Windows:
   Stratoscope-<version>-windows-setup.exe; run it.
3. Look for my local LLM setup: a Strata server (default http://127.0.0.1:8095),
   a llama-swap router in front of it, Strata's log folder, and the Kilo or
   OpenCode config. On Windows, `Stratoscope.exe --detect` shows what Stratoscope
   finds itself. Use only what you really find; the rest keeps its default.
4. Only if the defaults do not match my setup, write the settings file
   (~/.config/stratoscope.json on macOS, %LOCALAPPDATA%\Stratoscope\config.json on
   Windows). Keys: url, router, log, webui, compact_at, client_model, servers.
   Leave every other config alone and put no keys or secrets into it.
5. Check that it works: the speed shows in the menu bar or the taskbar next to
   the clock, and a click opens the panel. If the Windows readout is missing,
   read error.log in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Stratoscope and tell me why in plain words.
6. Tell me in a few lines what you installed, configured and saw. Ask me before
   you do anything that is not listed here.
```

### macOS

1. Download the latest `Stratoscope-<version>-macos.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/yosephyne/stratoscope/releases/latest).
2. Open it and drag Stratoscope to Applications.
3. Start it. On the first launch macOS warns you, because the app isn't notarized yet. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security, scroll down and click **Open Anyway**.

To start it at login: Settings → Start at login in the Stratoscope menu.

Built for macOS 13 or newer, Apple Silicon and Intel. Tested so far on Apple Silicon with macOS 27.

### Windows

Download `Stratoscope-<version>-windows-setup.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/yosephyne/stratoscope/releases/latest) and open it. The readout appears in the taskbar next to the clock, with the same panel as the Mac menu.

Windows 10 (1809) or newer, 64-bit. The app is not code-signed, so Windows may first show "Windows protected your PC": choose "More info", then "Run anyway". Settings are in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Stratoscope\config.json`. Differences from the Mac app: [docs/WINDOWS.md](docs/WINDOWS.md).

### Other platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| macOS | Works |
| Windows | Works |
| Linux | Not yet |

The inference engine adapters and all the numbers are platform-neutral. Only the menu bar part is macOS code, so another platform needs its own small front end: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#platforms).

## Supported inference engines

| Inference engine | Status |
|---|---|
| Strata | Works |
| Demo (fake data, to try the menu without an inference engine) | Works: `STRATOSCOPE_ENGINE=demo` |
| llama.cpp, MLX, Uzu, BaseRT | Not yet |

Each inference engine has a small adapter that turns its metrics into one common format. The menu only knows that format. If your inference engine exposes metrics over HTTP, writing an adapter is usually one file. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), or open an "Engine request" issue.

### Strata

Stratoscope reads `http://127.0.0.1:8095/metrics` by default. For the list of parked conversations it also reads Strata's log file. If you run a llama-swap router in front of Strata, set `router` and Stratoscope takes the model name and loading state from there.

**The line on the context bar.** Where a client summarises the chat is the client's decision, and Strata doesn't report it. Stratoscope reads it from the config of the clients that talk to your Strata: Kilo (`~/.config/kilo/kilo.jsonc`) and OpenCode (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`). It only counts a config that points at the same server address and names the model that is running, and it takes the model's context size minus its output size. Only those numbers and the server address are read, never your keys. If no config matches, or two disagree, the line uses your `compact_at`, and without that there is no line. Set `compact_at` for any other client. Set `client_configs` to `none` to turn the reading off.

Nothing is sent anywhere except requests to your Strata server. It never writes to Strata or its files. When Strata doesn't report a value, the menu shows `–` instead of guessing, and an estimated number gets a `≈`.

## Other setups

Strata listens on port 8095 unless it is started with `--port`, so the default works for a plain Strata. Everything else is a setting:

| Your setup | What you see | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Strata only, no router | Everything works. The model name is the one Strata reports. There is no "Loading" state, because only a router knows it | Nothing |
| Strata on another port | Found by itself on the usual ports. Otherwise "No engine found" for a minute | Set `url` (Settings → Open settings file). To check: `curl <url>/metrics` answers with JSON |
| Strata behind a router | Model name and loading state come from the router | Set `router` |
| Strata's log is somewhere else | The parked conversations show "In use" without details, and there is no "Open log" entry | Set `log` |
| A client other than Kilo or OpenCode | No line on the context bar | Set `compact_at` to the token count where that client summarises |
| Kilo or OpenCode, but their model id differs from what Strata reports | No line on the context bar | Set `client_model` to the id used in the client config, or `compact_at` |
| Client configs in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | Found there | Nothing |
| An engine other than Strata | Nothing (the item stays hidden) | Not supported yet, see [Supported inference engines](#supported-inference-engines) |

## Settings

Environment variables win over `~/.config/stratoscope.json`, which wins over the defaults. If you start the app from the Finder on macOS, use the JSON file, because the Finder doesn't pass your shell variables on. On Windows the file is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Stratoscope\config.json`, see [docs/WINDOWS.md](docs/WINDOWS.md#settings). There is no file until you need one: "Open settings file" in the menu creates it with every setting as a commented example; `//` comments are allowed.

| Variable | JSON key | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `STRATOSCOPE_ENGINE` | `engine` | Which inference engine to read: `strata` (default) or `demo` |
| `STRATOSCOPE_URL` | `url` | Inference engine address. Strata default: `http://127.0.0.1:8095` |
| `STRATOSCOPE_ROUTER_URL` | `router` | Router in front of the inference engine. `none` turns it off |
| `STRATOSCOPE_LOG` | `log` | Inference engine log file. Strata default: newest `*.log` in `~/.local/share/strata/install` |
| `STRATOSCOPE_WEBUI_URL` | `webui` | Adds an "Open chat UI" entry to the menu |
| `STRATOSCOPE_COMPACT_AT` | `compact_at` | Optional. Token count where your client summarises the chat, drawn as a line on the context bar. Used when Stratoscope can't find the value itself (see below) |
| `STRATOSCOPE_CLIENT_MODEL` | `client_model` | The model id your client config uses for this engine, if it differs from the name the engine reports |
| `STRATOSCOPE_CLIENT_CONFIGS` | `client_configs` | `none` stops Stratoscope from reading client configs |
| `STRATOSCOPE_THEME` | `theme` | `system` (default), `light` or `dark`: the look of the menu |

Example `~/.config/stratoscope.json`:

```json
{ "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8095", "webui": "http://127.0.0.1:3000", "compact_at": 60000 }
```

## Build from source

On macOS you need the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yosephyne/stratoscope.git
cd stratoscope
./scripts/build-app.sh --install    # builds and copies to /Applications
```

While working on it:

```bash
swift build                                     # build
./scripts/test.sh                               # tests
STRATOSCOPE_ENGINE=demo swift run Stratoscope   # run with fake data
./scripts/screenshot.sh                         # redo the images above (after any change to how the menu looks)
./scripts/make-dmg.sh                           # build the DMG that goes on Releases
```

On Windows you need the .NET SDK 10: `dotnet test Sources/Windows/Stratoscope.Windows.sln` and `.\scripts\windows\build.ps1`.
