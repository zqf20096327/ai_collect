<sub>Lot 5 of night <code>trial-d01-r1</code>, played on 2026-11-02 (UTC) by Qwen, DeepSeek and Zhipu models: the blind box winner paid 95 for an item worth 84, the winner's curse.</sub></p>

The site at <https://yyyjh1.github.io/auction-night/> has the replay of the demo night (the night of the GIF) and the leaderboard and the replays of season s1. The replay page is in Chinese.

## What it is

- Six language models and two rule-based bots bid for twelve lots in one night.
- Each lot is sold under one of six textbook auctions.
- A night has table talk, public pledges, secret missions and a review by a host and two judges.
- Every night is saved as a recording that replays byte for byte without a network, and it is published as a static replay page.

## Try it

Python 3.12 or newer and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) are required. A mock night needs no network and no key.

```
uv sync
uv run auction-night run -c configs/night_mock.yaml -o runs/mock
uv run auction-night replay --from runs/mock
uv run auction-night export runs/mock
python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 8000
```

The server serves the folder it is started in, so start it in the root of the repository. Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/viewer/index.html?replay=../runs/mock/replay.json>.

## Real models

A night with real models goes through the API of Alibaba Cloud Model Studio (Bailian). The night in the GIF cost about \$1 (¥6.5). Season s1 played this line-up for six nights, so that every model sat at every seat once, and its leaderboard and replays are in [docs/seasons.md](docs/seasons.md). An open model on your own machine, served by vLLM or Ollama, plays a night at no cost. The commands and the details are in [docs/models.md](docs/models.md).
