## What you need

- Windows 10 or 11 and an NVIDIA graphics card (RTX 20-series or newer, 8 GB of video memory or more; her camera
  eyes need 16 GB), with a recent driver
- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/) (tick **Add python.exe to PATH** when you
  install it) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- About 45 GB of free disk. Setting her up downloads about 15–20 GB and takes 30–60 minutes
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) key for her language model (recommended: a few dollars a month), or
  [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with a model of 27B or more and a graphics card big enough for it (see
  [Which language model?](#which-language-model))

## Which language model?

Her ears, voice, memory and eyes always run on your PC. Her language model, the part that thinks and writes her
replies, runs one of two ways:

- **Semi-Local (recommended)**: through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) on your own key. In almost all cases
  this is the better choice: she uses the models she was tested with, answers fast, and it only costs a few dollars
  a month (about $1.50 if you talk 30 turns a day, about $5 at 100 turns a day).
- **Fully Local**: on your PC with [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Use a model of **27B parameters or more**; **70B or
  more** gives the full, reliable experience. Models smaller than 27B may be really bad: she loses her character,
  forgets what you told her and breaks her reply format. A local model is also slower: all her thinking takes turns
  on it, so after you interrupt her, or while she saves a memory or reflects, a reply can take 5–50 s.

A local model needs its own video memory on top of the ~6 GB her ears, memory and voice use (~10 GB with her eyes):
about 19 GB for a 27B model such as `gemma3:27b`, 24 GB for a 32B one such as `qwen3:32b`, and 50 GB for a 70B one
such as `qwen2.5:72b`. So one 32 GB card (RTX 5090) holds a 27B model next to all of her (a 32B one only with her
eyes off); a 24 GB card does not. A 70B model fits next to her only on a 72–96 GB workstation card. Otherwise run
Ollama on a second PC (the Setup page takes its address), or stay Semi-Local. Whichever model you run, pick one that
supports Chinese, since her prompts are written in it (`llama3.3:70b`, for one, does not). How to switch:
[Optional add-ons](#optional-add-ons).

## Set her up

Open PowerShell (a normal window, not as administrator) and run these lines one at a time. They put her in
`C:\OpenAmika`, a short folder that OneDrive does not sync:

```powershell
cd C:\
git clone https://github.com/zeekk0/OpenAmika.git
cd OpenAmika
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup_windows.ps1   # her brain, ears, memory and eyes
envs\brain\Scripts\python.exe scripts\setup_tts.py                   # her voice, her Live2D model, the paper doll: type yes
.\Start_OpenAmika.bat                                                # start her
```

Her voice, her Live2D model and the paper doll are free under MekaHime's personal-use license (see
[Licenses](#licenses)): the `setup_tts.py` line shows it first and downloads her files only after you type `yes`.

Both setup commands end with a summary, one line per part: `OK` when it is done, `!!` with the fix when it is not,
and `--` for information only (for example: no OpenRouter key yet, your first visit asks for it). Running a command
again resumes and skips everything that is finished. When the `setup_tts.py` summary shows `OK voice MekaHime_Amika`
and `OK Live2D model Amika`, she has her voice and her body; `OK paper doll Host` is the stand-in for her helpers
([Her helpers](#her-helpers-hermes-and-nanomuse)).

## Talk to her

Double-click `Start_OpenAmika.bat` in the OpenAmika folder (in PowerShell: `.\Start_OpenAmika.bat`). One console
starts all of her, and your browser opens **http://localhost:53000** when she is ready: about a minute, a few more
the very first time. On your first visit she introduces herself and asks your name, your city and, if `brain\.env`
has none yet, your OpenRouter key. Then press the power button and talk, or type. Click the page once so the browser
lets her speak.

The light at the top right of every page is her health: green means everything works; click it to see what is not.
Double-click `Stop_OpenAmika.bat` (or press Ctrl+C in her console) to stop her. To check everything without starting
anything, run `envs\brain\Scripts\python.exe launch.py --check`: it ends with `result: ready`, or names what to fix.

To update her: stop her, run `git stash`, `git pull` and `git stash pop` in the OpenAmika folder (this keeps your
name, your city and your edits), then run the two setup commands again (they fetch only what changed).

## If something goes wrong

| what you see | what to do |
|---|---|
| `Python 3.11 was not found` | Install Python 3.11 (tick "Add python.exe to PATH"), open a new PowerShell window and run the setup again. |
| `!! voice MekaHime_Amika  not downloaded: her license was not accepted` | Run `envs\brain\Scripts\python.exe scripts\setup_tts.py` again and type `yes`. |
| `!! voice MekaHime_Amika  Hugging Face refused the download (HTTP 401)` | Her files are not public yet, or your `HF_TOKEN` is wrong. Set a read token from [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) in the same window (`$env:HF_TOKEN = "hf_..."`) and run the command again. |
| `download failed after 4 tries` or `Check the internet connection` | Run the same command again: it continues where it stopped. If huggingface.co cannot be reached from your network, set `$env:HF_ENDPOINT` to a Hugging Face mirror first; every file is still checked. |
| `does not see the GPU (CUDA)` | Update your NVIDIA driver and run the setup again. Without an NVIDIA card: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup_windows.ps1 --cpu`. |
| `The filename or extension is too long` | The folder's path is too long for Windows: move OpenAmika to a short folder such as `C:\OpenAmika` and run the setup there. |
| `settings.json not found` | Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup_windows.ps1` first. |
| `No Live2D model yet` on the stage, or `!! Live2D model` / `!! her voice` in `launch.py --check` | Run `envs\brain\Scripts\python.exe scripts\setup_tts.py`. |
| `no OpenRouter key yet` (`launch.py --check`, the setup summary) | Paste your key in the first-run wizard, or after `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=` in `brain\.env`. |
| `!! TTS (voice)  port 8002 answers but has no voice MekaHime_Amika` | Another voice server uses her port (OpenSakura's uses 8002 too). Stop it, or give her another port: change `8002` in `tts_url` and in `services.tts` (`--port`, `health`) in `settings.json`. |
| She answers in text but you hear nothing | Give her voice about 20 seconds after a start, then click the page once. The health light must show TTS green. |
| Her voice stutters or is very slow | Close other programs that use the graphics card, or turn her eyes off: `"vision": {"enabled": false}` in `settings.json`. |
| On Ollama she is out of character, forgets things, or her replies come out broken | The model is too small. Use one of 27B or more (70B or more for the full experience), or go back to OpenRouter: Setup → Brain → OpenRouter → "Switch back to the OpenRouter preset". |
| On Ollama she answers very slowly | If `ollama ps` shows a CPU/GPU split instead of `100% GPU`, the model does not fit in your video memory next to her. With `100% GPU`, slow replies after you interrupt her, or while she saves a memory or reflects, are normal for a local model. See [Which language model?](#which-language-model). |
| A helper's card on the Tools page is red, or she says she cannot reach Hermes or nanoMuse | Run `envs\brain\Scripts\python.exe launch.py --check` and look at its `agent` and `hermes key` lines; every message and its fix is in [docs/TOOLS.md](docs/TOOLS.md#when-it-does-not-work). |

Every part writes a log in `logs\`. For anything else, ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mekahime) or open an
[issue](https://github.com/zeekk0/OpenAmika/issues). Using an AI coding agent? Point it at
[README_IF_YOU_ARE_AI_AGENT.md](README_IF_YOU_ARE_AI_AGENT.md).

## Optional add-ons

- **Fully Local**: install [Ollama](https://ollama.com), run `ollama pull gemma3:27b` (17 GB; or another model of
  27B or more, see [Which language model?](#which-language-model)), then on the Setup page choose Brain → Ollama →
  Detect models → Use this model. No key needed. For Ollama on another PC, type its address there before Detect models.
- **Her helpers**: Hermes Agent or nanoMuse run errands for her, with the paper doll beside her on stage
  ([below](#her-helpers-hermes-and-nanomuse)). Any other MCP server works too, on the Tools page
  ([docs/TOOLS.md](docs/TOOLS.md)).
- **Smart home**: Zigbee plugs she can switch ([IoT/README.md](IoT/README.md)). It stays off until you read and
  accept the IoT safety statement ([docs/IOT_DISCLAIMER.md](docs/IOT_DISCLAIMER.md)) on the Tools page. She runs on
  language models and can make mistakes: never connect heaters, locks, valves or anything that could cause harm.
- **Text her** on Discord or Telegram ([docs/MESSENGERS.md](docs/MESSENGERS.md)).
- **Your phone**: `Tailscale_Serve_OpenAmika.bat` makes her reachable on your own devices over
  [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com).

## Her helpers: Hermes and nanoMuse

She can hand errands to a helper program on your PC, [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) or
[nanoMuse](https://github.com/nano-muse/nanoMuse): it searches the web, uses a browser and works with files. She
decides whether to help, gives the helper the task after she has answered you, relays its questions, and tells you
the result in her own words. While a helper is switched on, MekaHime's paper doll stands at the bottom right of her
stage and plays the helper's side. Each helper runs its own model on OpenRouter, and the key she uses works for it.

**Hermes Agent**: install it from a PowerShell window. This form of its installer asks no questions; the lines
after it do the setup OpenAmika needs:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.ps1))) -NonInteractive
```

Then, in a new PowerShell window:

```powershell
hermes model                                    # choose OpenRouter, paste your key, then "Enter custom model name": z-ai/glm-5
$key = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString('N')          # a random key for its API server
hermes config set API_SERVER_ENABLED true
hermes config set API_SERVER_KEY $key
hermes gateway stop                             # a Hermes already running reads the key only when it starts again
```

**nanoMuse**: clone it into the `Nanomuse` folder, give it a `config.toml` and put your key in its own vault; the
commands and the file are in [docs/TOOLS.md](docs/TOOLS.md#set-up-nanomuse).

**Connect them.** In the OpenAmika folder, run `Copy-Item config\tools.example.json config\tools.json` (only if
there is no `config\tools.json` yet) and `notepad config\tools.json`. Set `"enabled": true` at the top and in the
helper's entry. For nanoMuse, `"NANOMUSE_LANGUAGE"` is the language it answers in (`"en"`; or `"ja"`, `"zh-CN"`).
For Hermes, copy its key with this line and paste it (Ctrl+V) as `"HERMES_API_KEY"`:

```powershell
(Select-String -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes\.env" -Pattern '^API_SERVER_KEY=(.+)').Matches[0].Groups[1].Value | Set-Clipboard
```

Save and start her (`.\Start_OpenAmika.bat`): she starts her helpers herself. On the Tools page the helper's card
turns green (`agent online`).

**Meet the paper doll.** Open the Use page: the doll slides onto her stage. Ask her, for example, "Can you have
Hermes check tomorrow's weather?". She answers, types the task in her speech bubble, and the doll takes over: it
thinks while the helper works, speaks the helper's steps in its own bubble, looks surprised when the helper has a
question or needs your OK (say yes or no, or click Approve on the Use page), and is happy when the result comes,
which she then tells you. The doll comes with `setup_tts.py` (`OK paper doll Host` in its summary).
