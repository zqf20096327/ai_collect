# Tayang Studio

Tayang Studio is a free, open-source desktop app that helps Indonesian creators make motion videos without writing prompts. It picks topics, writes scripts and handles the prompting, while the user's own AI agent (Claude Code, opencode, Gemini CLI, Codex, Antigravity CLI or any ACP agent) does the building.

## Install

macOS and Linux:

```
curl -fsSL https://studio.tayang.app/install.sh | sh
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```
irm https://studio.tayang.app/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both install the latest release and open it. Installed copies update themselves.

- **macOS:** the app goes into /Applications (or ~/Applications if /Applications isn't writable).
- **Linux (x86_64 and ARM64):** the `.deb` with apt, the `.rpm` with dnf, yum or zypper, or the AppImage in ~/.local/share/tayang-studio when there is no sudo. The AppImage needs FUSE 2.
- **Windows:** installs for your user only, so no admin is needed.

Options: `TAYANG_VERSION=0.0.2` installs that version. `TAYANG_INSTALL_DIR` sets the macOS folder. `TAYANG_LINUX_PACKAGE=deb|rpm|appimage` picks the Linux package. `TAYANG_NO_LAUNCH=1` skips opening the app. Or download an installer from [Releases](https://github.com/Maru-Yasa/tayang-studio/releases).

## Run it from source

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev:desktop
```

Requires Node 22+, pnpm and Rust. See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for the full setup, the API and where data lives.

On Linux the app runs on WebKitGTK 2.40 or later. On older versions it still works, but the preview panel always shows its narrow layout (short button labels, no frame chip, no key hints), because those layouts use CSS container queries.

## Scripts

| Script | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm test` | `pnpm -r test` | Run tests in every workspace package |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `pnpm -r typecheck` | Type-check every workspace package |
| `pnpm dev:desktop` | `pnpm --filter @tayang/desktop tauri dev` | Run the desktop app in dev mode |

## How it works

- The agent runs over ACP. Tayang has no AI of its own: every generation goes through the agent you already use.
- Installs go through the agent too. Tayang shows you every command your agent asks to run, and nothing it asks about runs until you allow it, unless you turn on Auto mode for chats, you are copying a style from a video (a style study always runs in auto mode), or an autopilot is making a video (autopilots always run in auto mode). Installs always ask. An agent whose own settings already allow a command won't ask, so check your agent's permission settings (see `docs/development.md`).
- You pick a working folder. Projects live there and keep their folder if you change it later. Agent sessions work in the working folder or in a project's own folder.
- App data is stored in a local SQLite database, so the desktop app keeps its data on this computer and doesn't need the API (your agent still needs its own internet connection).
- The Tayang API (studio.tayang.app/api, closed source) is optional and only adds the online features: sign-in, paid plans, built-in styles and install stats.

## Privacy

Tayang sends a random install ID, your system (macOS, Windows or Linux), its version, your computer's processor type and the app version once a day. Nothing about you or your videos. The API stores no IP address, name or path.

To turn it off, open Settings › Account and switch off "Share anonymous install stats".

Signing in is optional. Settings › Account › "Sign in with Google" opens your browser at the Tayang API (studio.tayang.app/api, or the API address you set), where you continue with Google. Google shares your email address and name with the Tayang API, which keeps them with your account and plan; nothing else from your Google account is asked for. The desktop app keeps a sign-in token in the OS keychain (Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, Secret Service on Linux), tied to that API address. Only if this computer has no keychain at all does it keep the token in `auth.json` in the app's data folder, readable by your user only (other programs running as you, such as the agent CLIs, could still read it). If you deny Tayang access to the keychain, signing in stops with an error instead. Signing in needs an https API address (plain http only to this computer, for local development). The token is never shown in the app's window. It also caches your email, name and plan so the account still shows offline. "Sign out" revokes the token at the API when it can be reached and removes it from this computer.

Paid plans (Lite, Creator, Pro): "Pay now" opens a payment link on the Tayang API (`<api>/pay/…`) in your browser, and the API sends you on to the payment provider, currently SumoPod, where you pay with QRIS from your banking or e-wallet app. The app only ever opens links on the API it talks to, so the provider can change without an app update. Tayang stores your plan, when it ends, and each payment's plan, amount, status and the provider's payment ID. It never sees or stores card, bank or e-wallet details. The desktop app asks the Tayang API for your plan with your sign-in token, which stays out of the app's window, and remembers on this computer which period end it already reminded you about.

While online payments are off, plans are bought over WhatsApp instead. "Pay now" then opens `<api>/pay/whatsapp` with the plan and your account's email in the link (so they can show up in your browser history), and the API sends your browser on to a WhatsApp chat with the Tayang team, with a message already filled in: the plan, its price and that email. Nothing reaches the team until you press send in WhatsApp. Sending it shares your WhatsApp number and name with the Tayang team, and the chat goes through WhatsApp (Meta), under WhatsApp's own privacy policy. Once the team has checked your payment, they turn your plan on by hand, and Tayang stores a payment record with the plan, amount, how it was paid and who turned it on. While that page is open, the app asks the Tayang API for your plan every 15 seconds, for up to 30 minutes, to notice when it is on.

Gift codes (Settings › Account › "Have a gift code?") give one gift per account and one per computer per promo. To tell computers apart, redeeming a code sends the Tayang API a SHA-256 hash of your computer's machine ID (macOS IOPlatformUUID, Windows MachineGuid, Linux machine-id), never the ID itself, and the API hashes it again with its own secret before storing it with the gift. Nothing is sent for this until you redeem a code.

To show your Claude usage, Tayang reads the login Claude Code already stores on this computer and sends it only to Anthropic to fetch your usage numbers.

The Style screen loads YouTube thumbnails from i.ytimg.com for styles copied from YouTube, and built-in style previews from the Tayang API at studio.tayang.app/api. A style copied from a video keeps a short silent preview clip and a poster frame on this computer; the video itself is deleted after the study.

Set `TAYANG_API_URL` when starting the desktop app to point it at another API (a base with the path, e.g. `http://localhost:8787/api`); it is used as given instead of the saved API URL and never stored.
