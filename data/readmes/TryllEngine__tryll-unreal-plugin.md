# Tryll for Unreal Engine

Tryll runs language, speech-to-text and text-to-speech models on the player's own machine, and
connects them to your game through workflow-driven agents. This repository holds the Tryll Unreal
plugins, version 0.10.2.

- **Platform:** Windows x64
- **Docs:** https://docs.tryllengine.com/v0.10/

## The plugins

| Folder | What it does | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `TryllClient/` | The Tryll client: agents, workflows, speech, the editor windows, and the Tryll server | — |
| `TryllMetaHumanLipSync/` | Optional. Drives MetaHuman faces from Tryll speech | `TryllClient` |
| `TryllMCP/` | Optional. Lets an AI coding agent create and check Tryll workflows through the editor's MCP server | `TryllClient`, UE 5.8 |

Prebuilt zips per Unreal Engine version:

| Plugin | Unreal Engine |
|---|---|
| `TryllClient` | 5.7, 5.8 |
| `TryllMCP` | 5.8 |
| `TryllMetaHumanLipSync` | 5.7, 5.8 |

## Install from a release zip

This is the easy way. It works in Blueprint-only projects.

1. Open [Releases](https://github.com/TryllEngine/tryll-unreal-plugin/releases) and download the zips for your Unreal Engine version:
   `TryllClient-0.10.2-UE<version>-Win64.zip`, plus any optional plugin.
2. Unzip each one into your project's `Plugins/` folder, so you get `Plugins/TryllClient/`,
   `Plugins/TryllMetaHumanLipSync/` and so on.
3. Open the project. The **Tryll Welcome** window opens. Accept the licence there; the editor starts
   the Tryll server only after you accept.

The `TryllClient` zip includes the Tryll server, so there is nothing else to download. To package a
game, install Visual Studio 2022 with the "Game development with C++" workload: packaging compiles
the plugins for your game.

## Install from source

Use this when you want to change the plugin code. Your project needs C++ (a code project), because
Unreal compiles the plugins.

1. Copy the plugin folders from this repository into your project's `Plugins/` folder.
2. From the same release, download `tryll-server-0.10.2-win64-full.zip` (CUDA and Vulkan) or
   `tryll-server-0.10.2-win64-lite.zip` (CPU and Vulkan), and unzip it into
   `Plugins/TryllClient/Binaries/ThirdParty/TryllServer/Default/`.
3. Open the project and let Unreal build the plugins.
