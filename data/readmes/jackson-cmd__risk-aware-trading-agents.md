|---|---|
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW!-e5534b" alt="NEW!"> | **🗞️ 2026 news in the box**: 16,945 news items for the 64 stocks of the built-in lists ship with the package (Benzinga headlines, titles only, and SEC 8-K filings, January to November 2026), so `riskaware backtest --news`, or the new **Replay news** switch on the dashboard's Backtest page, works with nothing to download. In 2026 so far the built-in agent with news returned **+15.9%** against SPY's +12.1%, with a max drawdown of **-5.3%** against -8.9%. [Results →](#2026-so-far-with-news) |
| <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW!-e5534b" alt="NEW!"> | **🧪 Describe a strategy, the AI writes and tests it**: over MCP, Claude, Codex or Gemini read `strategy_guide`, write the strategy as code and run it with `backtest_code`.

[How →](docs/news-history.md) |

<sub>0.4.0 gave each agent its own LLM review (GPT, Claude or a free local model) with every decision on record, and made the news harder to fake; 0.3.0 added daily paper-trading agents, the MCP server and the new dashboard; 0.2.0 added options to the backtester and four stock strategies.

## 💡 The idea

Most trading bots either chase every signal or need a quant team to configure. This one follows a simple, explainable discipline that long-term investors already use: buy quality stocks when they pull back to their moving averages, add when fear is high and the earnings still hold up, trim when prices run too far, never panic-sell into uncertainty, and always keep a cash reserve. Four agents check the market, the calendar, the company and the news; a deterministic risk manager has the final word on every order.

> Not financial advice. It starts in paper mode, and live trading needs three explicit switches.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Macro-aware market regimes.** VIX and its term structure (VIX/VIX3M), sector breadth, credit appetite (HYG vs IEF), safe-haven demand, a fear-and-greed gauge computed from free data (and CNN's Fear & Greed for reference), and the **FOMC, CPI, jobs report, PPI, GDP and PCE** calendar put the market in one of four regimes: risk-on, neutral, uncertain, risk-off.
- **Buy low, sell high.** Pullbacks to **EMA 50 / 100 / 200**, RSI(2) and z-score mean reversion, **quality dips that must pass an earnings check** (revenue growth, margins, free cash flow, leverage, EPS beats), breakouts and trend continuation in strong markets. Take-profit trims when a stock runs far above EMA50; trend exits after a break of a falling EMA50.
- **No panic selling.** When the regime is uncertain or risk-off the agent holds, does not sell, and only buys at strong support. Only a disaster the company itself confirms (bankruptcy, delisting, restatement in its own 8-K or press release) or an optional hard stop can force an exit.
- **Risk first.** A **30% cash + T-bill floor**, position, sector and speculative ("lottery ticket") caps, volatility-scaled sizes, buying in tranches, a Treasury sleeve for conservative profiles, idle cash parked in a T-bill ETF, a drawdown pause, a kill switch.
- **Cross-verified news.** Finviz (free), Google News, Nasdaq, Seeking Alpha and Yahoo RSS plus the company's own **SEC 8-K filings**. A story only counts toward the company it names, and it is confirmed when two independent outlets, the company's own press release or its SEC filing carry it; a red flag on a confirmed story blocks new buys. Only the company's 8-K, or its own release confirming what independent outlets reported first, can force a sale, so a fake headline, a fake press release and the outlets that repeat it, or another company's bad news cannot. A denial clears the story it refutes instead of confirming it.
- **10 brokers, one interface.** Built-in paper account, **Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, Public.com, Charles Schwab, tastytrade, Tradier, Futu/moomoo, Tiger Brokers, Longbridge**.
- **Options strategies (backtest).** An aggressive call-buying strategy and the wheel (cash-secured puts and covered calls), with premium caps, put collateral outside the cash floor, assignment and expiry.
- **Backtest anything, including your own strategy.** Write one Python method; the same strategy object runs in backtests, paper and live trading with the same risk engine. Compare strategies side by side with an HTML report, and replay point-in-time news: 2026 headlines and SEC filings ship with the package, and other years come from a local archive (SEC 8-K filings, your own Benzinga key or a CSV).
- **Daily paper-trading agents.** Run several strategies side by side, each on its own paper account with free prices. A background job trades them every trading day, and a leaderboard compares them with SPY.
- **Works with Claude (MCP).** `riskaware mcp` gives Claude, Cursor or any MCP client the regime, signals, news, backtests and the paper agents. Describe a strategy in words and the AI writes it as code and backtests it, checked for look-ahead.
- **Optional LLM review, per agent.** A bull analyst, a bear analyst and a risk judge (GPT, Claude, any OpenAI-compatible model such as DeepSeek or Qwen, or a free local model through Ollama) can nudge conviction by at most ±0.15 or veto a buy. They can never create a trade or change a limit. News reaches them only as quoted, untrusted text, and every prompt and reply is kept in the local journal so you can see how each decision was made.
- **Bilingual.** CLI, dashboard, reports and docs in English and 中文.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackson-cmd/risk-aware-trading-agents
cd risk-aware-trading-agents
pip install -e ".[dashboard,mcp]"    # Python 3.10+
```

```bash
riskaware init                        # 2-minute wizard: language, risk profile, broker, watchlist
riskaware regime                      # market regime, VIX, fear & greed, next FOMC / CPI / jobs report
riskaware scan                        # today's signals, each with its reasons
riskaware analyze NVDA                # what every agent thinks about one stock
riskaware news AAPL                   # cross-verified headlines
riskaware backtest --compare buy_and_hold,ema_bounce
riskaware run                         # one paper-trading cycle (built-in paper account)
riskaware agents init                 # four starter paper-trading agents
riskaware agents run                  # let them trade once now
riskaware agents schedule --install   # ...and every trading day from now on
riskaware dashboard                   # web UI (English / 中文)
```

No account or API key is needed for any of the commands above. Add `--lang zh` to any command for Chinese output.

## 🤖 Paper-trading agents

An agent is a strategy with its own paper account. Pick a strategy (built-in or your own file), a risk profile, a stock list and the starting cash, and the agent trades that account once every trading day on free Yahoo Finance prices. Run several side by side and see which one beats SPY. Agents only ever use the built-in paper account, never a broker.

```bash
riskaware agents init                                    # steady, momentum, breakout, fear-buyer
riskaware agents add dips --strategy rsi2 --universe tech --cash 25000
riskaware agents add mine --strategy my_dip.py:MyDip --profile aggressive
riskaware agents add luna --strategy risk_aware --llm openai:gpt-5.6-luna   # with an LLM review board
riskaware agents add local --strategy risk_aware --llm ollama:qwen2.5:3b    # a free local model
riskaware agents run                                     # trade every active agent now
riskaware agents why luna                                # how it decided: setups, risk check, bull / bear / judge
riskaware agents                                         # the leaderboard
riskaware agents schedule --install                      # every trading day, by itself
```

The daily job (a LaunchAgent on macOS, a crontab line on Linux, a scheduled task on Windows) wakes every 15 minutes on weekdays and trades each agent once per trading day after 15:40 New York time, before the close. It skips holidays, catches up after the laptop sleeps, and keeps going when one agent fails. Each agent keeps its account, journal and daily equity in `~/.riskaware/arena/NAME/`. The **Agents** page of the dashboard shows the leaderboard and lets you create, run, pause, reset and delete agents; its **Decisions** tab shows how each decision was made, including the LLM's bull case, bear case and verdict and the exact prompt it was sent. GPT needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env`; a local model needs [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (`ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`); and `--llm claude-cli`, `codex-cli` or `gemini-cli` uses your Claude, ChatGPT or Gemini plan through its command-line tool, with no API key. More in [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md).

<img src="site/assets/agents_en.jpg" width="820" alt="Agents page: a leaderboard of paper-trading agents with equity, return, comparison with SPY and status">

## 🔗 MCP server

`riskaware mcp` serves the agents over the Model Context Protocol, so Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor or any MCP client can use them, on your plan and without an API key. `riskaware mcp-setup` prints (or, with `--apply`, runs) the one step that connects it:

```bash
pip install -e ".[mcp]"
riskaware mcp-setup claude-desktop --apply   # or: claude-code, codex (your ChatGPT login), gemini, antigravity
```

Thirteen tools: `market_regime`, `scan`, `analyze_stock`, `stock_news`, `list_strategies`, `backtest`, `strategy_guide`, `backtest_code`, `agents_leaderboard`, `agent_detail`, `agent_decisions`, `agents_create` and `agents_run`. They are read-only or act on local paper accounts; no tool can send an order to a broker. Then just ask, for example "What regime is the market in, and what is coming up this week?" or "Backtest the wheel on megacap with $1M since 2018." ChatGPT itself only connects to remote servers, so on the OpenAI side use Codex, which runs on your ChatGPT login. More in [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md#use-it-from-claude-chatgpt-or-gemini-mcp).

## 🧪 Strategy lab

Describe a strategy in plain words and let the AI build it. Over MCP, Claude, Codex or Gemini read `strategy_guide`, write the strategy as a Python class and run it with `backtest_code`. Before the code runs, the lab refuses dates and stock tickers written into it (both let a backtest know the future), files, network and private attributes. Then it backtests the code in a separate process with no API keys and a time limit, and returns the metrics next to SPY and buy-and-hold, or the lines to fix.

> Write a strategy that buys two-day pullbacks in uptrends when the recent news is positive, and sells after 10 days or at +8%. Backtest it on the tech list for 2026 with news.

`save_as` keeps a strategy that works: it then shows up on the dashboard and can run as a paper agent. For code from anywhere else, `riskaware lab my_strategy.py --preset tech` does the same checks and backtest. More in [docs/strategy-lab.md](docs/strategy-lab.md).

### What the agent does in each regime

| Regime | Typical trigger | Buys | Sells | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **Risk-on** | SPY above a rising EMA50 and EMA200, VIX < 20, most sectors above EMA200 | pullbacks, breakouts, dips | take profit, trend exits | 100% |
| ⚪ **Neutral** | none of the others | EMA support, mean reversion, quality dips | take profit | 75% |
| 🟡 **Uncertain** | 2 days before an FOMC decision, the day before CPI or the jobs report, VIX 20–30, fear gauge < 35, downtrend | EMA100 / EMA200 support only | **none: hold** | 50% |
| 🔴 **Risk-off** | VIX ≥ 30, VIX backwardation below EMA200, credit stress | quality dips and broad ETFs, small tranches | **none: hold** | 35% |

Emergency exits (a severe red flag the company itself confirms in its 8-K or its own press release, or the profile's hard stop) work in every regime.

### Risk profiles

| | Conservative | Balanced | Aggressive |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cash + T-bill floor | 30% | 30% | 30% |
| Treasury sleeve (IEF) | 15% | 5% | 0% |
| Max single stock / sector | 5% / 20% | 7% / 25% | 10% / 35% |
| Speculative sleeve (high-volatility names) | 0% | 3% (2 names) | 7% (3 names) |
| Minimum conviction | 0.65 | 0.58 | 0.52 |
| Earnings score needed for a dip buy | 70 | 60 | 50 |
| Take-profit trigger | +20% | +25% | +30% |
| Breakout entries | off | off | on |

Every limit can be overridden in `riskaware.yaml`. Positions are built in tranches (50% / 25% / 25% of the target); a later tranche needs a deeper support touch or a winning position, and trimmed positions can be rebuilt on the next pullback.

## 📊 Backtest

Built-in strategy, balanced profile, the 55-stock `megacap` list, $100k, signals at the close and fills the next day, 5 bps slippage, January 2018 to November 2026:

| | risk_aware | SPY buy & hold |
|---|---|---|
| CAGR | 10.4% | 14.1% |
| Volatility | 9.3% | 19.0% |
| Sharpe | 0.84 | 0.66 |
| Max drawdown | -18.2% | -33.7% |
| Worst calendar year | -3.7% | -18.2% |
| Average stocks / cash + T-bills | 57% / 39% | 100% / 0% |

<img src="site/assets/backtest_equity_en.png" width="820" alt="Equity curve versus SPY with regime shading">

Read it honestly: in a long bull market the agent earns less than the index because it keeps at least 30% in cash, and it loses roughly half as much when markets fall. The list is today's large caps, so it carries survivorship bias; these numbers use neither news nor fundamentals (2026 with news is below), and past results do not predict future ones. Reproduce it with `riskaware backtest --compare buy_and_hold`.

```bash
riskaware backtest --strategy risk_aware --compare buy_and_hold,ema_bounce,rsi2 --start 2018-01-01 --open
riskaware backtest --preset etf --profile conservative
riskaware backtest --symbols AAPL,MSFT,NVDA,COST --cash 25000
riskaware backtest --synthetic                     # offline demo, no download
```

Every run writes a self-contained HTML report (metrics, equity and drawdown charts with regime shading, monthly returns, every trade with its reason) plus CSV files.

### 2026 so far, with news

The same agent and settings on 2026, from January 2 to November 11, now reading the news that ships with the package: 15,542 Benzinga headlines and 605 SEC filings for these 56 stocks, each day only what was out before its close.

| January 2 – November 11, 2026 | risk_aware + news | risk_aware, no news | SPY buy & hold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Return | **+15.9%** | +15.4% | +12.1% |
| Volatility | 8.2% | 7.8% | 14.0% |
| Sharpe | 1.70 | 1.73 | 0.77 |
| Max drawdown | **-5.3%** | -5.3% | -8.9% |
| Average stocks / cash + T-bills | 60% / 35% | 61% / 34% | 100% / 0% |

<img src="site/assets/backtest_2026_news_en.png" width="820" alt="2026 equity and drawdown of the risk-aware agent with news versus SPY, with regime shading">

The agent beat SPY by 3.8 points while holding stocks with 60% of its money on average, and its worst drop was 60% of SPY's: in the March sell-off it fell 5.3% while SPY fell 8.9%. News added half a point of return this year. Ten months is a short test, so the 2018–2026 table above is still the better guide. Reproduce it with `riskaware backtest --preset megacap --start 2026-01-02 --end 2026-11-11 --news`.

### News in backtests

A backtest may only use news it would have seen on that day, so it needs each item's publication time. News for 2026 ships with the package: 16,945 items for the 64 stocks of the built-in lists (Benzinga headlines, titles only, and SEC 8-K filings, January 1 to November 11, 2026). For other years, `riskaware news-history` keeps an archive on your own machine (`~/.riskaware/news`, never in the repository). `--news` replays both through the same clustering and two-source check used in live trading. Each day sees only items published before its close (16:00 New York, 13:00 on early-close days), and orders fill the next day.

```bash
riskaware backtest --strategy examples/strategies/news_earnings_drift.py --preset megacap --start 2026-01-02 --news   # 2026: nothing to download
riskaware news-history build --preset core --contact-email you@example.com   # SEC 8-K filings since 2018
riskaware news-history build --symbols AAPL,NVDA --source benzinga             # with your own BENZINGA_API_KEY
riskaware news-history import my_news.csv --tz America/New_York               # timestamp, symbol, headline[, source, url, sentiment]
riskaware news-history status
riskaware news-history show NVDA --date 2024-05-22                             # what the backtest saw at that close
riskaware backtest --strategy examples/strategies/news_earnings_drift.py --preset core --news --compare buy_and_hold
```

| Source | What goes into the archive | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Bundled with the package | 2026 Benzinga headlines (titles only) and SEC 8-K filings for the 64 stocks of the built-in lists | free, already installed |
| SEC EDGAR | every 8-K (earnings, officer changes, deals, impairments, restatements) with SEC's acceptance time | free; SEC asks for a contact email |
| Benzinga | headlines from your own news API key | your Benzinga plan |
| CSV | any news you have the right to use | — |

The `core` preset is SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, META and TSLA. SPY and QQQ are funds, not companies, so the SEC archive has little or nothing for them; the FOMC, CPI and jobs calendar already drives the regime in every backtest. Benzinga counts as one publisher, so a Benzinga-only story stays single-source until an SEC filing or a second publisher backs it. What you download or import stays on your machine. Details: [docs/news-history.md](docs/news-history.md).

**More history.** We keep a much larger archive, about 3.2 million Benzinga headlines from 2011 to 2026. It is far too big to ship in the package, so the package carries 2026 for the built-in lists. If you need more years or more stocks, open an issue and we will look at how to provide them, for example as a separate download.

## 📚 Strategy library

Every built-in strategy runs through the same risk manager, so all of them keep the cash floor. Backtest any of them with `riskaware backtest --strategy NAME`; compare several with `--compare a,b,c`.

| `risk_aware` | stocks (default) | the multi-agent strategy described above |
| `momentum_rotation` | stocks | each month hold the strongest names by 6-month relative strength, above EMA200 |
| `donchian_breakout` | stocks | Turtle-style: 55-day highs on volume, exit on a 20-day low |
| `bollinger_reversion` | stocks | buy closes below the lower Bollinger band in uptrends, sell at the middle band |
| `fear_greed_dca` | stocks / ETFs | buy in steps when fear is high, trim in extreme greed |
| `ema_bounce`, `rsi2`, `golden_cross`, `buy_and_hold` | stocks | simple references and baselines |
| `aggressive_calls` | options | buy ~0.6-delta calls 45–60 days out on pullbacks in strong uptrends; +100% take profit, -50% stop |
| `wheel` | options | sell ~0.25-delta cash-secured puts near support; after assignment, sell covered calls above cost |

Backtests from January 2018 to November 2026 on the `megacap` list:

| Strategy | Profile, capital | CAGR | Sharpe | Max drawdown | Worst year |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `wheel` | aggressive, $1M | 14.1% | 1.12 | -21.7% | +5.8% |
| `momentum_rotation` | balanced, $100k | 12.5% | 0.91 | -18.2% | -8.2% |
| `risk_aware` | balanced, $100k | 10.4% | 0.84 | -18.2% | -3.8% |
| `donchian_breakout` | balanced, $100k | 9.8% | 0.86 | -12.6% | -6.7% |
| `aggressive_calls` | aggressive, $100k | 6.7% | 0.30 | -40.3% | -24.7% |
| `bollinger_reversion` | balanced, $100k | 4.5% | 0.58 | -4.4% | +0.8% |
| SPY buy & hold | | 14.1% | 0.66 | -33.7% | -18.2% |

### Options (backtest only)

Option strategies open long calls or puts, cash-secured puts and covered calls. The risk manager caps the premium in long options (`options_sleeve`: 0% conservative, 3% balanced, 12% aggressive; `options_per_trade`: 0 / 1% / 3%), keeps put collateral out of the 30% cash floor and inside the single-stock cap, and never lets shares that back a written call be sold. Expiring options settle at intrinsic value; written puts are assigned into shares, covered calls are called away.

There is no free archive of historical option quotes, so the backtester prices options with Black-Scholes on a modelled implied volatility (VIX for index ETFs; realized volatility, a 10% volatility premium and a VIX scaling for stocks) and pays half of a 4% bid-ask spread plus $0.65 per contract. The results move with these assumptions: without the 10% volatility premium the wheel drops to a 0.81 Sharpe and `aggressive_calls` ranges from 3% to 15% a year depending on spread and volatility, always with a drawdown near -40%. Treat option backtests as the shape of a strategy, not a forecast. `riskaware run` skips option orders in this version.

Written puts need cash for 100 shares per contract inside the single-stock cap, so the wheel only trades names whose strike × 100 fits (about $10k per name on a $100k aggressive account); test it with `--cash 1000000` or a list of lower-priced names.

## 🧩 Write your own strategy

```bash
riskaware new-strategy my_dip          # creates my_dip.py from a template
riskaware backtest --strategy my_dip.py --compare risk_aware,buy_and_hold
riskaware run --strategy my_dip.py     # paper trade it
```

```python
from riskaware.strategy import Action, Signal, Strategy

class MyDip(Strategy):
    name = "my_dip"
    default_params = {"rsi_entry": 30, "take_profit": 0.20}

    def on_bar(self, ctx):
        signals = []
        for sym in ctx.universe:
            row = ctx.row(sym)                 # indicators at today's close
            if row is None:
                continue
            pos = ctx.position(sym)
            if pos is None and row["close"] > row["ema200"] and row["rsi14"] < self.params["rsi_entry"]:
                signals.append(Signal(sym, Action.BUY, strength=0.7, reason="oversold in an uptrend"))
            elif pos and pos.gain >= self.params["take_profit"]:
                signals.append(Signal(sym, Action.SELL, strength=0.8, fraction=0.5, reason="take profit"))
        return signals
```

A strategy only says what it wants and how sure it is; the risk manager decides the size and enforces the cash floor, caps and regime rules, so your strategy inherits the same protection. `ctx.market` has the regime, VIX and upcoming events; `ctx.quality(sym)` and `ctx.news(sym)` give the earnings verdict and the verified news in live runs; `ctx.news` also works in backtests run with `--news`. See [docs/custom-strategies.md](docs/custom-strategies.md). Or describe the strategy and let an AI write it in the [strategy lab](#-strategy-lab).

## 🔌 Brokers

| Broker | `broker.name` | Paper trading | Install | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Built-in paper account | `paper` | always | built in | tested |
| Alpaca | `alpaca` | yes | built in | **tested on a paper account** (orders, fills, cancels, full cycle) |
| Public.com | `public` | no (live only) | built in | unit-tested against the documented API |
| Tradier | `tradier` | sandbox | built in | unit-tested against the documented API |
| Interactive Brokers | `ibkr` | paper account | `.[ibkr]` | written against `ib_async` |
| Charles Schwab | `schwab` | no | `.[schwab]` | written against `schwab-py` |
| tastytrade | `tastytrade` | cert sandbox | `.[tastytrade]` | written against the `tastytrade` SDK |
| Futu / moomoo | `futu` | simulate | `.[futu]` | written against `futu-api` (OpenD) |
| Tiger Brokers | `tiger` | paper account | `.[tiger]` | written against `tigeropen` |
| Longbridge | `longbridge` | paper account | `.[longbridge]` | written against `longport` |

Setup for each broker (keys, gateways, paper accounts) is in [docs/brokers.md](docs/brokers.md). Reports from live use of the SDK-based adapters are very welcome.

## 🔒 Safety

- `riskaware run` uses the paper account unless you change the broker; `--dry-run` previews without sending anything.
- A live order needs `execution.mode: live` in the config **and** `--live` on the command line **and** a typed confirmation (or `--yes`).
- Guards: limit price within a band of the quote, a per-order value cap, a maximum number of orders per run, no trading on market holidays, and deterministic client order ids so a rerun on the same day cannot duplicate an order.
- `riskaware halt` blocks all order submission until `riskaware resume`.
- Every run, decision and order is written to a local SQLite journal (`~/.riskaware/journal.db`), visible in the dashboard.
- API keys stay in `.env` (see [.env.example](.env.example)); they are never written to the config or the journal.

## 🔧 Configuration

`riskaware init` writes a commented `riskaware.yaml`; every key is optional.

```yaml
language: en                 # en | zh
profile: balanced            # conservative | balanced | aggressive
profile_overrides:
  cash_floor: 0.30           # cash + T-bill ETF never below 30%
  hard_stop: 0.30            # emergency exit after a 30% loss (null = never)
broker:
  name: alpaca
  options: {paper: true}
universe:
  preset: megacap            # megacap | tech | defensive | etf | sectors (combine with +)
  symbols: [PLTR, SHOP]
  cash_vehicle: SGOV         # idle cash goes into T-bills
news:
  min_independent_sources: 2
llm:
  enabled: false
  provider: anthropic        # or openai (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
```
