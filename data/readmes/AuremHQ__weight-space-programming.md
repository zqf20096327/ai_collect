## Problem → Edit → Result — our real runs

- **Problem:** Qwen3-0.6B and SmolLM2-1.7B looped on 60-item lists — asking for 60 different animals gave repeats.
- **Edit:** a tiny weight change — 131,072 weights (0.022%) on Qwen, 129,897 weights (0.0076%) on SmolLM2. No retraining, no gradients.
- **Result:** Qwen 37.78 → 67.22 (+29.44); SmolLM2 76.11 → 85.56 (+9.44). Good and neighbours stayed at 100.
- **Gate:** 2 of 7 runs passed. The other 5 were refused and shipped 0 weights.
- **Proof:** every run, pass and fail, is published in [REAL-RUNS.md](REAL-RUNS.md).
- **Last updated 7 November 2026** — numbers current as of 6 November 2026.

## The 30-second version

- **MIT CSAIL showed** a frontier model can read and write neural network weights directly — no training, no gradients.
- **One tiny edit** (0.016% of weights) fixed a model's reasoning loop: MATH **7.9% → 48.1%**.
- **This repo turns that idea into a skill** you can run on your own small open-weight model — with evaluation, not enthusiasm, deciding whether any edit ships.

**This repo is not affiliated with MIT.** It is an independent implementation inspired by their public research, with full credit below.

## Real runs — our numbers (not MIT's)

We ran the kit on **real models** — Qwen3-0.6B, GPT2-124M, and SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, local CPU, no LLM editor. **7 real runs, 2 gate passes.** Here is what actually happened. Full numbers: [REAL-RUNS.md](REAL-RUNS.md).

| Run | Model | Failure | Diagnosis | Causal proof | Weights changed | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pipeline test** | Kit weights (smoke test) | Failing 64.14 vs good 75.98 | Row 0 | **+18.00 — PASSED** | **128 (0.77%)** | **PASSED — failing 64.14 → 75.43 (+11.29)** |
| **Qwen run 1** | Qwen3-0.6B | 60-item lists loop (60 animals → only 16 distinct) | Layers [27, 26] | −3.33 — FAILED | **0** | **FAILED — nothing shipped** |
| **Qwen run 2** | Qwen3-0.6B | Same failure | Layers [27, 26] | **+32.22 — PASSED** | **0** | **FAILED — nothing shipped** (attempt numbers contaminated by a restore bug — see clean re-run) |
| **Qwen clean re-run** | Qwen3-0.6B | Same failure, restore bug fixed | Layers [27, 26] | **+32.22 — PASSED** | **0** | **FAILED — nothing shipped** (all 3 clean attempts made failing worse: −11.11 / −11.11 / −12.22) |
| **GPT-2 run** | GPT2-124M | 60-item lists loop (animals 1.7, countries 5.0, fruits 1.7) | Layers [10, 11] | −1.11 — FAILED | **0** | **FAILED — nothing shipped** |
| **Qwen narrow Try 1** | Qwen3-0.6B | 60-item lists loop, narrow eval | Layers [27, 26] | **+23.89 — PASSED** | **0** | **FAILED — nothing shipped** (all 3 subtraction attempts destroyed the model at greedy) |
| **Qwen narrow dampen** | Qwen3-0.6B | Same failure, narrow eval | Layers [27, 26] | **+23.89 — PASSED** | **131,072 (0.022%)** | **PASSED — failing 37.78 → 67.22 (+29.44)** |
| **SmolLM2 run** | SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct | 60-item lists loop (Butterfly ×2, Elephant ×2, Giraffe ×3) | Layer 23 | −30.00 — FAILED | **129,897 (0.0076%)** | **PASSED — failing 76.11 → 85.56 (+9.44)** |

**What this proves:** the kit runs end-to-end on real models, finds real failures, diagnoses real layers — and **the gate works**: 5 of 7 runs were refused, and **2 real-model edits passed the gate** (SmolLM2 by subtraction, Qwen narrow by dampening).
**What it does not prove yet:** that the kit fixes real models in general. 2 passes out of 7 runs, both on the same narrow failure (60-item list looping) — that is the claim, not a general proof.

## Where it started — MIT's numbers

```
MATH-500           7.9%  ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  →  48.1% ████████████████████
GSM8K             13.8%  ██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  →  67.1% ██████████████████████████
IFEval            21.0%  ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  →  62.3% █████████████████████████
Answers hitting the token limit    93%  →  33%
Weights changed: 131,072 — just 0.016% of the model
```

How: the model (Qwen3.5-0.8B) kept getting stuck repeating itself until it ran out of tokens. The researchers traced the loop to one direction written by the MLPs of layers 15 and 19, and subtracted it. The model didn't learn new math — **it already knew the math; the loop was hiding it.**

Full details, all 8 experiments, and the honest limits: see [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md).

## Founder's vision

> **Big AI should not belong only to people who can pay for big models and big retraining bills.**
> Small, local, cheap models are already in everyone's hands — they just need to perform at their best. This kit exists to make a small local model give **better results**, one tiny proven edit at a time, without retraining and without sending your data anywhere. If the numbers don't improve, nothing ships. That honesty is the product.
>
> **This kit is free for everyone, and it stays free.** A small model should not mean bad results — everyone has the right to the best experience and the best results. The team's vision is simple: everyone should benefit from this kit.

## How the skill works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Detect: find weights + failure] --> B[Diagnose: find the direction]
    B --> C[Fix: subtract or dampen it — under 1% of weights]
    C --> D{Eval gate: same prompts, same settings}
    D -->|Improved +5, no guard regression| E[Ship as reviewable change]
    D -->|Not improved| F[Discard — ship nothing]
```

1. **Detect** — Find the weights in your repo, run your model on your own test prompts, diagnose the failure, and measure it first (how often, how bad) — that baseline is what the eval gate compares against. No weights, no test prompts, or a model that's too large → the skill refuses, clearly, and does nothing.
2. **Fix** — Subtract the offending direction from the identified layers only, or dampen the suspect columns down (the Qwen pass used dampening by 0.25). Edits are tiny by design: anything over 1% of weights is rejected as "too broad."
3. **Eval-gate** — Re-run the *same* prompts with the *same* settings. The fix ships only if the primary metric improves by at least 5 points with no guard-metric regression worse than 2 points. Otherwise the edit is discarded. **No gate, no ship.**

Full rules, refusals, and safety gates: see [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

## How this differs from gradient descent

Gradient descent trains: data + loss → gradients → many small updates → a retrained model. This skill is a different path: one direct edit, no data, no gradients, no training loop — and the eval gate decides whether it ships.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    G[Data + loss] --> H[Gradients] --> I[Many small updates] --> J[Retrained model]
    K[Diagnosed direction] --> L[One subtraction or dampening] --> M[Re-test + eval gate] --> N[Reviewable fix — or nothing]
```

If you want training, use training. If you want to try removing one stubborn failure without retraining, use this.

## Run it

The skill is runnable as `wsp-kit`. From a clone:

```
pip install './kit[real]'
wsp demo
```

`wsp demo` runs the quick pipeline check end to end and writes `report.json`. For a real model:

```
wsp run --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --eval kit/evals/loop-fix-qwen3-0.6b.json --out-dir out
```

That runs the full gated pipeline — temperature sweep, baselines, diagnosis, causal proof, up to 3 edit attempts — and writes `report.json`. If the gate fails, the out-dir holds only the report: **nothing ships**.

For agents and harnesses, the same pipeline is an MCP server (requires `pip install 'wsp-kit[mcp]'` first):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wsp-kit": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "wsp.mcp_server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Who this is for

| ✅ This is for you if… | ❌ This is NOT for you if… |
|---|---|
| You have a **small open-weight model** (Qwen, Gemma, Llama class) in your own app or software | Your model is served by an API (ChatGPT, Claude…) — its weights are never in your hands |
| It has **one specific, repeatable failure** — looping, a stuck behaviour, a narrow quirk | You want to "make my model smarter" — editing removes obstacles, it does not add abilities |
| You have test prompts that show the failure | Your model is large — this is practical today only for small models |

---

## Try it on your model

1. Point the skill at your weights and your failing prompts.
2. Get a diagnosis and a tiny, reviewable edit.
3. Let the eval gate decide — if the numbers don't improve, nothing ships.

That's the whole deal. No retraining bill, no blind trust.

## Keep it improving — in the background, live

Fixing a model once is not enough — it will fail at new things. So the kit can keep working in the background, and your running model can keep improving without you doing anything. The loop and live model are available, not yet benchmarked — no published run of them exists yet, so the claim is only that they run, not that they improve a model.

**What it is, in plain words:**
- **`wsp loop` watches for failures.** When your model fails at something — you write the failure in a file, or drop in a test file — the kit runs the gated pipeline on it. If the fix passes the gate, it becomes a new version. If it fails the gate, nothing ships, and the same failure is never retried.
- **`wsp serve-model` serves your model and applies each new passing fix to the SAME running model** — the old weights are overridden by the updated ones, in place. No reload, no restart, no swap. The next prompt automatically uses the updated weights. If a fix ever feels wrong, one rollback undoes it exactly.

**How to run it (two commands, two terminals):**

```
wsp loop --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --watch-dir ./evals-incoming --out-dir ./wsp-loop-out
wsp serve-model --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --versions-dir ./wsp-loop-out
```

Your app talks to the live model at `http://127.0.0.1:8900` (`POST /generate`). The loop keeps improving in the background; the model keeps using the updated weights. The user gets the benefit without doing anything.

**The safety rules never change:** the eval gate (+5/−2), the 1% weight cap, and the 3B model cap apply to every run. Only gate-passing edits for your exact model are ever applied, and the original weights are always kept for instant rollback.

## Honest limits — why you can trust this repo

- The MIT work is a **blog post, not a peer-reviewed paper**. **Not peer-reviewed; Hugging Face rebuilt the edited model from the authors' logs** (re-ran its evaluation, made a live demo).
- Demonstrated so far mainly with **one editor model (GPT-6 Astra)**. Whether other models do this equally well is **unproven** — our reports name the editor behind every run (ours is a numerical estimator, no LLM).
- This is a **batch job, not real-time**: load weights, run evaluations, reason, edit, re-evaluate. It never runs live inside a chat reply.
- **Two real-model edits have passed the gate** (SmolLM2 +9.44, Qwen narrow +29.44) — and five runs ended with the gate refusing and nothing shipping. That is published above, not hidden.

## Questions, answered

**What is wsp-kit?**
wsp-kit by Aurem is a free, open-source engineering tool for small models. It tries to fix one specific, repeatable failure in a small open-weight model by editing its weights directly — no retraining, no fine-tuning, no gradients.

**Does wsp-kit fix real models?**
Twice so far, out of seven runs. The pipeline test passed (failing 64.14 → 75.43, +11.29), and two real-model edits passed the gate: SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct (failing 76.11 → 85.56, +9.44, layer 23, 129,897 weights) and Qwen3-0.6B narrow-animals by dampening (failing 37.78 → 67.22, +29.44, layers [27, 26], 131,072 weights). The other five real-model runs failed the gate and shipped 0 weights. The numbers are published in [REAL-RUNS.md](REAL-RUNS.md).

**How do I try wsp-kit?**
One command installs the skill and the kit, sets up the `wsp` command, and runs the demo automatically: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AuremHQ/weight-space-programming/main/install.sh | bash`. Then `wsp auto` fixes your own model — it asks 4 simple questions and runs by itself. To keep improving in the background, run `wsp loop` and `wsp serve-model` — see "Keep it improving" above.

**Is wsp-kit free?**
Yes. Free for everyone, MIT licensed. A small model should not mean bad results.

**What is the eval gate?**
The eval gate re-runs the same prompts with the same settings after an edit. The edit ships only if the failing metric improves by at least 5 points with no more than 2 points regression on guards and neighbours, at serving temperature and greedy. If the numbers don't improve, nothing ships.

**Which models does wsp-kit support?**
Small open-weight models up to 3B parameters that you control. Closed API models (ChatGPT, Claude) are refused — their weights are never in your hands.

**What do I need to run wsp-kit?**
Python 3.9+ and numpy run the demo. Real models need `pip install 'wsp-kit[real]'`, which adds torch, transformers and accelerate. The published runs used CPU in bfloat16 and took about 32 to 58 minutes for Qwen3-0.6B and about 35 minutes for GPT2-124M.

**What does the install command do?**
It downloads SKILL.md into `~/.claude/skills/weight-space-programming` (backing up an existing copy), downloads the kit into `~/.wsp-kit`, adds a `wsp` launcher in `~/.local/bin` (no sudo, PATH unchanged), and runs the demo, which needs no model download. To uninstall, delete those three locations. To read the script first, download install.sh and run it yourself.

**Is wsp-kit the same method as MIT's?**
No. wsp-kit is an independent implementation inspired by the MIT CSAIL blog post of 2 November 2026 and is not affiliated with MIT. In MIT's experiment a frontier LLM, GPT-6 Astra, read the weights and made the edit with up to 50 forward passes. wsp-kit uses a numerical estimator with no LLM. MIT's numbers are theirs, not ours.

**Does wsp-kit subtract or dampen?**
Both have passed the gate: subtraction on SmolLM2 and dampening on Qwen. In our runs, a positive causal proof pointed to dampening and a negative one to subtraction, but REAL-RUNS.md says there is no single editor yet.

**Can an edit remove safety behaviour?**
It can, which is why the kit refuses safety-removal requests and every edit goes through the eval gate and human review (kit README, Limits).

**Can I undo an edit?**
Yes. Original weights are never overwritten: edited weights go to a new directory, and applying an edit is a separate step (`wsp apply-edit`). On a live model, `POST /rollback` undoes the last applied edit.
