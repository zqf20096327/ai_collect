### An open format for video breakdowns that models read layer by layer

**Every skill has a `SKILL.md`. Every video gets a `VIDEO.md`.**

A VIDEO.md package describes one video for AI agents and programs: what it shows and says, shot by shot, and, when the producer knows, how each shot was made and how to remake it. It starts with a small card and opens up level by level, down to a single shot. Every file says how many tokens it holds, and what was **seen** is kept apart from what was **inferred**.

## Why VIDEO.md

A full breakdown of one video runs to hundreds of thousands of tokens. A model that reads it for every question is slow, costly, and tends to repeat guesses as facts.

| | |
|---|---|
| 🗂️ **Many videos in context** | Keep each card in context, a few hundred tokens apiece, and open a package only when it is needed, as with skills. |
| 🪜 **Read only what the question needs** | Most questions are answered from the overview, about 2k tokens; with the timeline, about 4k, questions about single shots too. |
| 🏷️ **Cost before reading** | The map lists every file with its size in tokens. |
| 🔍 **Seen apart from inferred** | In the syntax (`made~`) and in the data (`inferred`, with a probability and who decided). |
| 🧩 **A stable surface for programs** | Front matter checked by a JSON Schema, a one-line-per-shot grammar, fixed ids. Unknown fields, keys and files are ignored, so the format can grow. |
| 🎬 **From a 6-second ad to a feature film** | Scenes and a split timeline for long videos, takes and beats for one-take streams, layers for split screens and reactions, camera moves and transitions for whip pans, orbits and match cuts. All optional. |
| 🌱 **Starts small** | Six fields make a valid card. Judging how a video was made is an optional module, not a requirement. |

## Quick start

```bash
pip install videomd
videomd check path/to/package      # lists every rule it breaks; exit code 1 if any
videomd read path/to/package       # card, map, timeline and shot data as JSON
```

```python
import videomd

errors = videomd.check("path/to/package")
pkg = videomd.read("path/to/package")   # {"card": {...}, "map": [...], "timeline": [...], "shots": {1: {...}}}
```

- **Building an agent or app?** Read [docs/integrate.md](docs/integrate.md): discovery, what to put in context, when to load more, honest answers.
- **Building a breakdown tool?** Read [docs/authoring.md](docs/authoring.md): from the smallest valid package to a full one.
- **Want to see one?** Open [examples/salted-egg/VIDEO.md](https://github.com/videomd/videomd/blob/main/examples/salted-egg/VIDEO.md), a real 21-shot package.
