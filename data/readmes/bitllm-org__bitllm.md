**BitTorrent for local LLMs.** Share your local model, use everyone's.

Every node runs the same binary. It can share an OpenAI-compatible server you already run
(vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio, MLX...), and it gives you a local gateway that
answers from whichever peer serves the model you ask for. There is no coordinator: peers find
each other through a Kademlia DHT and gossip, connect directly when they can, and go through a
relay plus hole punching when both sides are behind NAT.

Beta, MIT licensed. The network is live at [bitllm.org](https://bitllm.org). Invites set your
priority, not whether you can join: the [access rules](#how-access-works) decide who gets a slot
first, and uninvited nodes can still get idle slots. Using it needs no account and no wallet.

![The dashboard a running node serves: a terminal-style editor with a model list, a copyable setup snippet, and a test console](docs/images/dashboard.png)

## How the network fits together

Four jobs, one binary:

```
   your node                 public relay / seed           GPU host
  127.0.0.1:7778            DHT, relay, receipts          vLLM / Ollama
        │                          ▲                          ▲
        │  first contact           │                          │
        └──────────────────────────┘                          │
        │                                                     │
        └──────── direct, or relay + hole punch ──────────────┘
```

- **Your node** runs the same binary as everyone else. Its gateway listens on
  `127.0.0.1:7778` and speaks OpenAI and Anthropic, so an agent points at it
  like any API. By default nothing on the internet can call the gateway.
- **A serving node** is your node plus `--upstream`, pointed at a model server
  you already run. It can be behind NAT: peers reach it through a relay and
  hole punching, so no port forwarding is needed.
- **A public relay** is a node with inbound TCP and UDP 4001: start it with
  `--public`. It answers DHT queries and relays for NATed peers, but still
  joins the default seeds, so it needs no DNS record. Its announce carries
  `relay=true`; autorelay adds it as a candidate, so a NATed node reserves on
  the seed and on public relays instead of only on the seed. Before v0.5.0 it
  must serve a model, because only a serving node announces. From v0.5.0 it needs
  no model, once the seeds run v0.5.0 and can pass its announce on.
- **A seed** is a public relay that is also listed in
  `_dnsaddr.bootstrap.bitllm.org` and starts alone (`--dht-server`). It is the
  first contact for a fresh install. One seed is enough to join; public relays
  are what make relay capacity grow with the network.

Discovery has two steps. The binary resolves `_dnsaddr.bootstrap.bitllm.org`
to get seed addresses, then the DHT and gossip carry everything else: which
peer serves which model, how to reach it, and which public nodes can relay. If
the name does not resolve, it tries the `boot.bitllm.org` fallback; if that
fails too, the node starts alone and prints a join code that another machine
can pass to `--bootstrap`.

Only these pieces are centrally hosted, and none of them carries inference
traffic:

| piece | where | what it does | if it is down |
|---|---|---|---|
| DNS seed list | Cloudflare DNS, `_dnsaddr.bootstrap.bitllm.org` | names the seeds for first contact | a node with a join code still joins; `boot` covers a missing record, not a dead zone |
| site and installers | Cloudflare Worker, bitllm.org | the page, `install.sh`, `llms.txt` | installed nodes keep running; install by hand from GitHub |
| release binaries | GitHub | downloads, checksums, self-update | no new installs or updates |

Everything else is peer to peer: no coordinator, no database, no KV store.
Cloudflare serves DNS and the static site, not inference; the one exception is
traffic relayed through the temporary `boot` tunnel. DNS is used only to find
the first peer; an inference request goes from your gateway to the serving
peer, directly or through a relay. Public relays are not centrally hosted:
any operator with a public address can run one. The Mac mini that runs
`boot.bitllm.org` today is a transition fallback, not part of the design.

### What each piece depends on

| piece | needs | does not need |
|---|---|---|
| node and gateway | outbound internet; a seed or a join code to meet others | inbound ports, an account, a wallet |
| serving node | a local OpenAI-compatible server (vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio, MLX) | a public IP, a port forward, a seed role |
| public relay | a public address; inbound TCP and UDP 4001 | a DNS record, a GPU, a model |
| seed | a public relay listed in DNS; always on | a GPU, a model, a database |
| DNS seed list | a DNS zone for bitllm.org (Cloudflare here) and TXT records | a Worker or any runtime |
| site and installers | a Cloudflare Worker with static assets | KV, a database, the Mac mini |
| self-update | GitHub releases and `SHA256SUMS` | a package manager |

The seed is deliberately small and separate from the GPUs: a GPU that trains,
renders or switches off must not take first contact with it. A GPU host with
inbound can still be a public relay (`PUBLIC=1`), which adds relay capacity
without adding a DNS record. One seed is enough for a new node to join; a
second public relay, in DNS or not, keeps the network reachable when the seed
is busy. [docs/bootstrap.md](docs/bootstrap.md) explains the model and
[docs/seed-handoff.md](docs/seed-handoff.md) is the deployment checklist.

## Install and run

No port forwarding, no configuration. The script picks the build for your machine, verifies its
checksum and installs to `~/.local/bin` (no sudo). The node joins through the DNS seed list in
[docs/bootstrap.md](docs/bootstrap.md), or through `boot.bitllm.org` while that fallback lasts. If
neither answers, it starts its own network and prints a join code:
`bitllm --bootstrap /ip4/.../p2p/...`.

```bash
# macOS (Apple silicon), Linux (x86-64, arm64)
curl -fsSL https://bitllm.org/install.sh | sh
~/.local/bin/bitllm
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell): installs to %LOCALAPPDATA%\bitllm
irm https://bitllm.org/install.ps1 | iex
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\bitllm\bitllm.exe"
```

The examples below use `bitllm`; if `~/.local/bin` is not on your PATH, use the full path (the
installer tells you which; on Windows, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bitllm`). Prefer to download by hand? Take
the file for your system from [Releases](https://github.com/bitllm-org/bitllm/releases); on
macOS use curl, not a browser, to avoid the quarantine flag.

The node runs in the foreground. Then open http://127.0.0.1:7778, pick a model, copy the setup
for your agent, and send a test message. To leave it running after you close the terminal, see
[keep it running](#keep-it-running). 完整的中文说明见 [README.zh.md](README.zh.md)。

While it runs, `bitllm top` in another terminal shows peers, work exchanged and the log; see
[Watch and manage your node](#watch-and-manage-your-node).

## Share a model

You need an OpenAI-compatible server on this machine. Point the node at it:

```bash
bitllm --upstream http://localhost:8000/v1 --concurrency 2
```

- Without `--model`, every model your server lists is shared under exactly the id it reports. A
  Hugging Face id such as `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next` keeps its slash and its case. The node
  re-reads the list while it runs, so a model added to vLLM later appears without restarting
  BitLLM.
- `--model local=public`: use this only when your server's local name is not the name the
  network should use. The name on the left is what your server calls the model; the name on the
  right is the network name.
- `--concurrency`: how many requests you serve at once. Extra requests wait in this node's queue,
  in order of access class, which improves one step every 20 seconds as a request waits, but never
  past the best class; after that, arrival decides, so the longest wait goes first among equals.
  A full queue answers at once, so nobody waits on a place that does not exist.
- `--max-tokens` (default 32768): the most new tokens one peer request may ask for. Peers also get one
  choice per request (`n` is dropped).
- Requests from peers are narrowed: your node forwards known fields only, `data:` images only, and
  one prompt per `/completions` request. `--peer-field NAME` adds a field. Your own requests to your
  own server are not narrowed.
- Images: if your server caps images per prompt (vLLM's `--limit-mm-per-prompt`), the node learns the
  cap from the server's first refusal and from then on sends only the newest images, with a short note
  in place of each older one. Agents send every screenshot of a session again on each turn, so this
  keeps long sessions working. Nothing to set; restart the node after you change the cap.
- `--location LAT,LON` (optional): declare a coarse location for the network map. Give any point in
  your city, e.g. `--location 52.52,13.40`; the node announces only a cell of about 150 km, never the
  point. The map at bitllm.org shows only nodes that opted in. Without it your node is counted as
  "no location". Details: [docs/network-map.md](docs/network-map.md).

### More flags

`bitllm --help` lists every flag. These are less common:

- `--upstream-key KEY`: API key for your model server. Also `BITLLM_UPSTREAM_KEY`, which keeps it out of the process list.
- `--upstream-timeout DURATION`: how long the node waits on your model server for one request. Default 10 minutes.
- `--peer-field NAME`: forward one more request field from peers. Repeatable.
- `--peer-fallback`: when your own server is down, answer a model you share from peers. Those peers can read the prompts.
- `--open-slots N`: with `--open`, the most slots uninvited nodes may hold at once. Default half of `--concurrency`, at least 1.
- `--open-daily N`: with `--open`, the credits all uninvited nodes together may use per UTC day, then they wait for idle slots. Default 0, no limit.
- `--audit-every N`: with `--audit`, real requests to a peer between its spot checks. Default 50.
- `--audit-serve`: offer to score answers for other nodes' `--audit`, if your server returns prompt logprobs (vLLM).
- `--gateway ADDR`: the gateway's address. Default `127.0.0.1:7778`.
- `--gateway-key KEY`: key clients must send as their API key. Also `BITLLM_GATEWAY_KEY`. Needed when the gateway is on a non-loopback address; without it the node warns and the gateway is open.
- `--mdns`: find peers on the local network. On by default; `--mdns=false` turns it off.
- `--roots ADDR`: root account of the invite tree. Repeatable. Default the BitLLM root. For private networks and tests.
- `bitllm invite --revoke 0xADDRESS`: revoke an account. Roots only.

### Model names

A network name is just the `model` string clients send. Two machines that announce the same
string are interchangeable for it: the gateway picks one, and if it stops answering it tries
another. The name must identify the weights, not the machine.

1. **A public model uses its exact Hugging Face repo id.** `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next`, with the
   slash and the case as published. Independent hosts that serve the same repo match without a
   central registry, and one can replace another when it goes down.
2. **A fine-tune or quant uses the repo id of the actual weights**, if it has one; otherwise the
   base model plus a suffix that says what changed. Append the suffix to the repo id, for example
   `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-fp4-alesha`.
3. **A private or brand-new model can use any stable name.** Nothing has to be registered first:
   the node announces it, `GET /v1/models` lists it, and the dashboard lets a user pick it. Use
   `--model` only when the name the server reports locally is not the name clients should send.

The table below lists the short names the beta has used for its reference models. They are not a
gate; any id is accepted.

| network name | weights |
|---|---|
| `deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017` | DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, 1017 release, official weights |
| `deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017-heretic` | same, heretic (uncensored) fine-tune |
| `qwen3.8-flash-next-fp4-alesha` | Qwen3.8 Flash-Next, NVIDIA FP4-Local quant, alesha uncensored fine-tune |
| `qwen3.8-flash-next-nvfp4-lil` | Qwen3.8 Flash-Next, official weights, local-inference-lab NVFP4-MXFP8-CSF-QAD quant (served with NVIDIA Flare: fixed sampling, temperature 1.0 / top-p 0.95 / top-k 20) |

Same name must mean same weights. A Hub id is the simplest way to make that true across
operators.

**How names are built:** `<model>[-<quant>][-<source>]`, joined with hyphens; the model part keeps
the case and slashes of its Hugging Face repo id.

| part | what it says | when to leave it out | examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| model | the base model and release, as its maker names it | never | `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next`, `deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017` |
| quant | the weight format, if not the maker's own release | official weights as released | `fp4`, `nvfp4`, `int4`, `q4_k_m` |
| source | who changed the weights: fine-tune name, or the group that made the quant | official weights as released | `heretic`, `alesha`, `lil` |

How a server runs the model (vLLM or SGLang, context length, fixed sampling) does not change the
name; note it in the table instead. To add a reference name, open an issue with: the base model,
where the weights come from (link), the quant format and who made it, and anything a client
should know (fixed sampling, context length, image support). Your server's address is never
needed: nodes find each other on the network.

## Use the network

Every node, sharing or not, has a gateway at `http://127.0.0.1:7778/v1`:

```bash
bitllm                                 # use only, share nothing
curl localhost:7778/v1/models
curl localhost:7778/v1/chat/completions \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017","stream":true,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
curl localhost:7778/status             # your peer id, connections, ledger
curl localhost:7778/queue              # slots, running jobs and the wait list
```

No account is needed to use the network. `/v1/models` lists what is online right now, with the
number of nodes serving each one. Slot totals on the [network map](docs/network-map.md) count a node
once per model it serves, so adding up the models overstates capacity.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:7778` for a dashboard with copy-paste setup for your agent and a
connection test. The gateway speaks both OpenAI (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`) and
Anthropic (`/v1/messages`), so Claude Code works as is:

```bash
M=deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7778 ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=bitllm ANTHROPIC_MODEL=$M \
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL=$M ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL=$M ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL=$M \
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL=$M claude
```

OpenAI clients (Cline, Continue, OpenCode, Aider...): base URL `http://127.0.0.1:7778/v1`, any API key.
Anthropic requests need the serving peer's upstream to support `/v1/messages` (vLLM does).
The response header `X-Bitllm-Peer` says which peer answered.

A model you share stays on your machine: your gateway answers it from your own server, for free. If
your server is down, the gateway answers 503. `--peer-fallback` opts in to using peers instead, and
those peers can read the prompts.

Hosts narrow what they take from peers: known fields only, `data:` images only, one prompt per
`/completions` request. If a client sends an unusual field, the host may need `--peer-field` for it.

## Watch and manage your node

`bitllm top` is a live view of a running node in your terminal: who you are connected to, what
you share, the work exchanged with each peer, and the tail of the log, redrawn every second.

```bash
bitllm top                     # watch 127.0.0.1:7778
bitllm top --interval 2s       # a slower refresh
bitllm top --gateway 127.0.0.1:9000
q                               # quit; the node keeps running
```

It only reads the local gateway over HTTP, so it watches a node started any way you like: from
another terminal, from tmux, or as a service, and it never touches the node's state. If the
node stops it shows why and keeps retrying, so you can leave it open while you restart. In a
pipe (`bitllm top | cat`) it prints one frame and exits, which is handy over `ssh` or in a log.

The same data is available without a terminal:

```bash
curl localhost:7778/status        # peer id, addresses, connections, serving, uptime, ledger
curl localhost:7778/logs?n=50     # the last 50 log lines the node kept in memory
curl localhost:7778/credits       # credits per serving peer
```

The node keeps its last 500 log lines in a ring buffer for `/logs`, and still writes every line
to stderr, so nothing changes for a log file, `journalctl`, or a `tee` in your terminal.

### Keep it running

In tmux, if you want a terminal you can detach from and come back to:

```bash
tmux new -s bitllm 'bitllm 2>&1 | tee -a ~/.local/state/bitllm.log'
# ctrl-b d detaches and leaves it running; `tmux attach -t bitllm` comes back
```

On Linux, as a user service that starts at login and restarts if it stops:

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/bitllm.service
[Unit]
Description=BitLLM node
After=network-online.target
[Service]
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/bitllm
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now bitllm
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"      # keep it running after logout
journalctl --user -u bitllm -f      # the log
```

Add the sharing flags to `ExecStart` if the node also serves a model. On macOS, a LaunchAgent in
`~/Library/LaunchAgents` with `KeepAlive` does the same job.

### Updates

A release build checks for a newer release 30 seconds after it starts, and every 6 hours after
that. When there is one, it downloads the binary for this machine, checks it against the release's
`SHA256SUMS`, runs it once to confirm the version it reports, and swaps it in. If the node is
serving, it waits until no job is running and the queue is empty, then restarts itself in place:
same terminal, same systemd unit, same peer id. It waits up to 24 hours, then restarts anyway, so one
stuck client cannot hold an update back forever. `GET /status` shows `pending_restart: true` in the
meantime. On Windows a running `.exe` cannot be replaced, so the new binary is installed and used at
the next start.

HTTPS and the checksum catch a corrupted or truncated download. Each release also publishes
`SHA256SUMS.sig`, a signature over the tag and the checksum file, made with an admin's offline key
and checked against the public keys built into the binary. A release with a missing or wrong
signature is refused: nothing is downloaded and the running binary stays as it is. `bitllm update`
prints the result, and `GET /status` shows it as `signature`: `ok`, `missing`, `bad` or `no-keys`.

`--auto-update=false` stays on the version you have. `bitllm update` runs the same check now, which
is also the way to update a node under a supervisor. `--check` only reports, and exits non-zero if
the signature is not `ok`. `bitllm update --tag vX.Y.Z` installs that one release through the same
checks, which is how to try a prerelease, since the regular check skips those. It can also go back
to an older release, but a running node with auto-update moves forward again unless it is started
with `--auto-update=false`. The replaced binary stays next to it as `bitllm.prev`, so
`mv bitllm.prev bitllm` goes back one version.
Builds from source (`dev`) and CI builds never update themselves, and `bitllm update` on one of them
still requires a signature. `bitllm --version` prints what is running, and `GET /status` shows the
last check. The updater writes in the directory that holds the binary, so a package-manager install
or a read-only mount needs `--auto-update=false`; otherwise the node logs the error and keeps running.

A release the node installed by itself has to prove itself: until it has run for 60 seconds with its
gateway up, each start counts. After three failed starts, the next start puts `bitllm.prev` back and
restarts into it. That release is not installed again, while a newer one installs as usual.
`GET /status` shows `rolled_back_from` after such a start, and the failed binary stays as
`bitllm.failed`. This needs something to start the node again, such as the systemd unit above; in a
plain terminal the count only moves when you run it again. A node started with
`--auto-update=false` never swaps its binary by itself.

### Where things live

Everything the node stores is in `~/.bitllm` (`--data` moves it): the node key, the seed it signs
receipts with, the receipt log, the ledger, and the membership and quota state. Delete the
directory to start over with a new identity.

## Credits for serving

Every job you serve earns credits (prompt tokens / 4 + completion tokens), recorded in a receipt:
the client signs what it received (model, token counts, SHA-256 of the exact response bytes),
your node checks it against what it sent and countersigns, and the receipt is gossiped to the
whole network.

Receipts are self-reported. Both sides sign, but two keys can belong to one person, so a receipt
does not prove the work happened.

The client signs with one key per server, rotated every 30 days. That server can link your jobs to
each other, but other nodes cannot link you across servers. A receipt shows which server did the
work, not who asked for it.

Credits must equal the token formula, and each node accepts at most 120 receipts a minute per
server (600 overall) from gossip. Any node can verify both signatures and add up the credits from
the receipts it has heard, so totals can differ between nodes:

```bash
curl localhost:7778/credits      # credits per serving peer, from every receipt this node has seen
```

Receipts are stored in `~/.bitllm/receipts.jsonl`; a new node catches up from its bootstrap
peers. What credits will be worth is not decided yet. Which receipts count will be published
before it is: serving yourself through fake clients or serving a model other than the one named
will not count.

## How access works

Invites set priority, not entry. Three rules:

1. An invite gets you served on any free slot. Uninvited nodes are served only when a server is idle, unless its owner opens it to everyone.
2. There is no daily quota by default. A server owner can set one.
3. Sharing makes you a contributor: 10 invites instead of 3 once your nodes have served, and no quota on a server that asked your node for a job in the last 7 days.

If you are not a member yet, you can still use the network: you are served whenever a server is
idle, and a server started with `--open` serves you like a member. To become a member, ask a
member to invite your Ethereum address, then link this node to that address in the dashboard
("Link wallet" or `bitllm account link`). Linking is public, see [Accounts](#accounts). You do not
need a wallet to use the network, only an
address if you want an invite or a quota.

A member is the root account or anyone a member invited. Once your nodes have served a job you
have 10 invites for good. That limit reads public receipts, which are self-reported. Owners can set
a daily quota per member (`--free-daily`). Quota exemption does not read public receipts. It comes
from what a server has seen itself: your node did a job that server asked for within the last 7
days. A server that never asks peers for jobs exempts nobody.

A root can revoke an account (`bitllm invite --revoke`). That account and everyone it invited drop
to the uninvited tier, so they can still get idle slots. Everyone it invited can be invited again
by someone else.

Invites are signed with an Ethereum account and gossiped, so there is no membership server. Members
converge as signed items spread, and nodes can disagree for a while. Servers look up the requesting
node's account through its claim (below).

```bash
bitllm invite 0xADDRESS           # invite with a recovery-words account
```

With a browser wallet, use the Invite box in the dashboard instead.

### Serving only people you choose (`--allow`)

To share only with a few people, list their node ids (each node prints its id at startup, and
`curl -s 127.0.0.1:7778/status` shows it as `id`):

```bash
bitllm --upstream http://localhost:8000/v1 --model ... \
  --allow 12D3KooW...friend1 --allow 12D3KooW...friend2
```

- Listed nodes are served on any free slot, like members, whether or not they were invited.
  `--free-daily` still applies to them.
- Every other node is refused, members included, with
  `403 not allowed: this server serves only the peers its owner listed with --allow. Your node is
  12D3KooW...; send that id to the owner to be added`. Their gateway skips your server and tries
  others for the model at once; if yours is the only one, they get that message right away, not
  after a wait.
- Your model still appears in everyone's `/v1/models`, because the list is not announced.
- Without `--allow` nothing changes: the three rules above apply.
- The list is read at startup; restart the node to change it.

### Accounts

Credits are earned by nodes. To add up the credits of all your machines, link each node to one
Ethereum address. It is only a signature (personal_sign): no transaction, no gas, no RPC, nothing
on chain. A claim is signed by both the owner's wallet and the node's key, so nobody can claim
your node, and the newest claim per node wins.

**Linking is public.** It publishes this node's id with your wallet address and display name to
every node on the network. Decide whether you want that before you run these steps:

```bash
bitllm account new --name alice     # new 12-word account, links this node
bitllm account link --name alice    # link another machine to the same account
bitllm account                      # show who owns this node

Separately, each node keeps a private ledger of work exchanged with each peer
(`~/.bitllm/ledger.json`), kept as data.

## Run a seed

A seed is the first peer a new node dials. It answers DHT queries, relays for NATed peers until
they hole-punch a direct connection, and serves the receipt history a node syncs on join. It is a
public relay that is also listed in `_dnsaddr`; it does not answer inference requests or decide
membership.

Keep the first seed separate from the GPUs. A small always-on VPS, or any machine with a public
address, is the usual choice, so a GPU that is training, rendering or switched off cannot take
first contact with it. One seed is enough for a new node to join.

```bash
bitllm --dht-server --port 4001 \
  --announce /ip4/203.0.113.10/tcp/4001 \
  --announce /ip4/203.0.113.10/udp/4001/quic-v1
```

A public host that should help but does not need to be a first contact runs as a **public relay**:

```bash
bitllm --public --port 4001 \
  --upstream http://localhost:8000/v1 \
  --announce /ip4/203.0.113.11/tcp/4001 \
  --announce /ip4/203.0.113.11/udp/4001/quic-v1
```

It joins the default seeds, answers DHT queries and relays, and needs no `_dnsaddr` record. Its
announce carries `relay=true`, so NATed nodes use it as an additional relay; this is how relay
capacity grows without adding DNS entries. Before v0.5.0 it must serve a model, because only a
serving node announces. From v0.5.0 it needs no model, once the seeds run v0.5.0 and can pass its
announce on. `deploy/gpu-host.sh` with `PUBLIC=1` installs a serving node this way.

Open TCP and UDP 4001. On a fresh Ubuntu VM, `deploy/bootstrap-vps.sh` installs the systemd unit
and prints the DNS records to publish. A home host can be a public relay too, with a port forward
or UPnP, but most home hosts are ordinary serving nodes: they join through a seed and peers reach
them by relay or hole punching.

Both `--dht-server` and `--public` force public reachability, so turn them on only when inbound
actually works. Otherwise the node advertises addresses nobody can dial. Only the first seed uses
`--dht-server`, because it has to start without the DNS list it is about to be published in; every
later public host uses `--public`, which joins the default seeds. A second seed needs a live one:
`bitllm --dht-server --bootstrap /dnsaddr/bootstrap.bitllm.org`.

[docs/host-a-gpu.md](docs/host-a-gpu.md) is the step-by-step for a machine that serves a model,
including the check that decides whether it can also be a public relay. `deploy/gpu-host.sh`
installs the service next to the model server.

The default list is a DNS seed list at `_dnsaddr.bootstrap.bitllm.org`. Publish it with
`deploy/seed-dns.py`, and a new node joins through any of the records. Adding or retiring a seed is
a DNS change, not a release. When neither that list nor the temporary `boot.bitllm.org` fallback
answers, a default node starts its own network and prints a join code; nothing fails. The failure
behavior is in [docs/bootstrap.md](docs/bootstrap.md).

No public IP? Put it behind an HTTPS tunnel that passes WebSockets (Cloudflare Tunnel, free):
`bitllm --dht-server --ws-port 4002 --announce /dns4/boot.example.org/tcp/443/wss` and point
the tunnel at `http://127.0.0.1:4002`. Others join with
`--bootstrap /dns4/boot.example.org/tcp/443/wss/p2p/<peer id>`. This puts Cloudflare in the
connection path, so use it as a fallback, not as the primary seed.

Announce a restart before you do it. Nodes redial a lost seed every 15 seconds, but a request
already streaming through your relay is cut when it goes down, and the user's agent may not retry it.

## What you should know

- **The peer that serves you sees your prompt**, like any inference provider. Transport is
  encrypted (Noise/TLS/QUIC), but the serving machine reads the plaintext. Don't send secrets.
- **Peers you connect to directly see your IP address**, and the peer serving you sees your node id.
  If that matters where you live, use the network through a VPN or Tor-capable VPS.
- If you share a model, the clients you serve can see your IP too.
- **A node could serve a different model than it claims.** Start with `--audit` (off by default) to
  spot-check the peers that answer you: about one request in 50 to a peer is followed by a canary
  request, and another node (the auditor) scores the answer token by token; a peer that keeps
  failing gets no requests for that model for 24 h (`GET /audits` shows the results). The default
  auditor is a node run by us, the maintainers; `--auditor PEER_ID` replaces it and
  `--auditor none` drops it. An audit is a spot check, not a proof:
  - It finds a server running another model, and a coarser quant (Q4 or below) on greedy requests.
  - It does not find a server that recognizes canaries (the prompts are public in the source), a
    quant swap on sampled requests only, or a light fine-tune swap such as official weights for heretic.
  - An auditor can lie: pass a cheater, or make up bad scores for an honest server. A shuffled
    control catches only an auditor that passes everything. Trusting the seed means trusting us.
  - A server and an auditor run by the same person can pass each other. Nodes of the same claimed
    owner or /24 are never paired, but unclaimed nodes on different networks can be.
  - `--weights NAME=HASH` is what the server says it loads. The node only relays its server and
    cannot prove it.
  Numbers and details: [docs/audit.md](docs/audit.md).
- `--upnp` (on by default) asks your router to forward the p2p port.
- **IPv6 exposes the p2p port.** With a public IPv6 address and a router that lets inbound IPv6
  through, anyone on the internet can reach port 4001 (the p2p port, not the gateway on 7778,
  which listens only on 127.0.0.1 by default). That is how peers get direct connections, but if you do not
  want an open port on that machine, start with `--ipv6=false` to listen on IPv4 only. The cost:
  IPv6-only peers can no longer dial you directly, so more of your traffic goes through relays and
  may be slower. On IPv4 nothing changes.

## Build and test

Go 1.26 or newer (`mise.toml` pins the toolchain). No C dependencies, one binary; packages follow the domain under `cmd/` and `internal/`.

```bash
go build -o bitllm ./cmd/bitllm
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...              # real libp2p nodes on 127.0.0.1; 30 to 60 s
```

Release binaries for all four targets, with checksums, come from `scripts/release.sh vX.Y.Z`.
The tests cover discovery, the relay-only path, the serving queue, receipts, the ledger and the
access rules. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the layout and the rules that are easy to break.

Protocol: `/bitllm/infer/1.1.0` (one JSON request line, zero or more `202` position lines while
the request waits for a slot, then one `200` header and the upstream body verbatim) next to the
older `/bitllm/infer/1.0.0`, which a client falls back to when a server does not know `1.1.0`.
Nodes find a model's servers through the DHT under a key derived from the model name, ask a provider
for its current announce over `/bitllm/hello/1.0.0`, and keep gossip (`bitllm/announce/1`) as the
fast path for free slots.

## Contributing

Bug reports, fixes and small features are welcome. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) says how
issues and pull requests are handled; read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before changing code. After a
change to networking, access or the gateway, run the external test workflow
(`.github/workflows/external-test.yml`), which joins the live network and sends real requests.
