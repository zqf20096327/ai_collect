## Build with agents, your way

Unstoppable Code brings Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and local models into one
app for your projects. Choose the provider and model for the task, then connect
different models across the steps of a pipeline instead of committing your
whole workflow to one provider.

- **Combine models in one pipeline:** chain prompts, scripts, and checks into
  repeatable workflows, choosing different models for different steps. Use Claude
  and GPT models together for code review, or switch models as your needs change.
- **Use subscriptions you already pay for:** connect a compatible Claude,
  ChatGPT, or Cursor plan to run Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor. Your provider's
  plan terms and usage limits still apply. You can also use local models or
  choose hosted models with AI credits.
- **Work in parallel:** give each task its own Git worktree so agents can work
  on separate changes without sharing a working directory.
- **Keep work moving from your phone:** use the mobile app to control work on
  a connected desktop when you're away from your desk.

The desktop and mobile clients are MIT-licensed;
hosted services such as accounts and cloud features are not included in this
repository.

- **Phone or tablet:** get the app on the
  [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unstoppable-ai/id6786961568), or
  find the Google Play link on the [download page](https://unstoppable.ai/download).
- **Every option** is on [unstoppable.ai/download](https://unstoppable.ai/download).
- **Linux** packages are `.deb` files for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or newer. Arch
  Linux installs from a pacman repository; see the
  [download page](https://unstoppable.ai/download).
- **macOS with Homebrew:** run
  `brew install --cask unstoppableweb/tap/unstoppable-code`. Homebrew picks
  the right build for your Mac, and the app keeps itself up to date. See
  [Install with Homebrew](https://unstoppable.ai/support/getting-started/install-the-app#install-with-homebrew)
  and the [tap](https://github.com/unstoppableweb/homebrew-tap).

  [Install the desktop app](https://unstoppable.ai/support/getting-started/install-the-app).

> [!NOTE]
> Agents need a model to run. Connect Claude, Codex, or a local model, or buy
> AI credits in your account. See
> [Connect Claude, Codex, or a local model](https://unstoppable.ai/support/agents-and-models/connect-claude-codex-or-a-local-model).

## Building from source

Each client builds on its own from a clone of this repository. Follow the README
in [`clients/desktop`](clients/desktop/README.md) or
[`clients/mobile`](clients/mobile/README.md) for what to install and which
commands to run.

Desktop builds use stable hosted service defaults. Mobile connectivity depends
on generated brand configuration and build settings. Follow each client's README
for configuration; a successful build alone does not verify sign-in or cloud
features.

- [Desktop source and build instructions](clients/desktop/README.md)
- [Mobile source and build instructions](clients/mobile/README.md)

## What runs on our servers

Accounts, AI credits, Remote Control, cloud chats, and a few other features
rely on services we run. [What runs on our servers](HOSTED-SERVICES.md) lists
each one, the data it handles, and the telemetry the apps send. To run Claude
Code and Codex chats through a gateway you control, see
[Use your own AI gateway](docs/ai-gateway.md).

## What's in this repository

- [`clients/desktop/`](clients/desktop/README.md): the desktop app for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- [`clients/mobile/`](clients/mobile/README.md): the iOS and Android app

Each folder holds its latest exported source, which may be a development
snapshot rather than a release. Snapshots are ordinary commits without a tag
or GitHub release. Tags named `source-desktop/<version>` and
`source-mobile/<version>` identify releases. The two folders update independently
and can represent different revisions. Mobile source may appear before its first
release tag.

## Source publishing and contributions

We publish client source under the MIT License with every release and as
development snapshots from main, so you can read it, audit it, build it, and
fork it. Snapshots can be synced manually or daily. They may be stale when
syncs are disabled, delayed, or failed.

This repository holds the desktop and mobile apps only. Our hosted services,
like accounts and cloud features, stay closed source.
[What runs on our servers](HOSTED-SERVICES.md) lists them, and each client's
build instructions cover service configuration. We don't take pull requests
here: we build every fix ourselves, so a clear issue is the best way to help.
