**Inbox zero for WhatsApp.** No bot, no ban risk, your chats never leave your Mac.

Turn your WhatsApp Desktop into a local MCP for Claude, with a dedicated UX: a Mac app that runs the panel and an MCP server on your machine, so your Claude can read and help you sort your WhatsApp.

zapzero reads the WhatsApp Desktop app's own database on your Mac, **read-only**. AI triages every chat (who is waiting on whom, how urgent, who this person is to you) and drafts a reply in your own tone of voice for everyone waiting on you. You clear it from the keyboard: **Y** opens the chat in WhatsApp with the reply typed in, you press Enter. Next.

<sub>Names and messages are made up.</sub>

## Why it is safe for your number

- **Read-only.** zapzero copies the database the official app already keeps on disk (`sqlite3 mode=ro` + `.backup`) and works on the copy. It never writes to WhatsApp's files.
- **No bot, no linked device, no unofficial API.** Nothing talks to WhatsApp's servers. To WhatsApp, it's just you using the app.
- **Nothing is sent by zapzero.** A reply is typed into WhatsApp Desktop; you press Enter. Commitments (dates, prices, yes/no) are left `[in brackets]` for you to fill, and **Y** selects a bracket instead of sending.
- **No zapzero cloud.** Snapshots and state live in `~/Library/Application Support/zap` (chmod 700). Only the excerpt of each conversation goes to the model you choose, with your own key.

## What you get

- **Categories by when:** Important or urgent · This week · Older than a week · You're waiting on them · Groups · Cleanup.
- **Areas by who:** Clients, Hiring, Team, Investors, Partners, Family, Friends, Home & services, Selling to you, Other. Once a day the AI suggests new areas from your pending chats ("Apartment renovation", "Events & talks"); accept one and it becomes a triage choice.
- **Your voice ("Seu jeito").** After the first scan the AI reads ~150 of your own messages, your 40 busiest chats and the groups you write in most, and writes who you are, one editable field per topic (where you live, work, family, people who matter, current projects, routine, languages), plus a guide to how you write. Accept or edit each part; triage uses it to know who's who and every draft follows your tone.
- **Performance ("Desempenho").** Week by week over the last 13: how often you answered within 24 h, how long you typically take, who never got an answer, split by saved contacts, strangers and groups. Computed from the snapshot, no AI. A "turn" is a message that arrives after you spoke and after an hour of silence, so a live back-and-forth counts once.
- **Calendar, through your own Claude.** When a reply names a time ("14h30 fica bom"), the panel offers "create the event in my calendar" (on by default, `C` toggles). After you press Y, zapzero runs your Claude Code headless (`claude -p`) with exactly one tool allowed, your calendar connector's create-event, and the event lands in your calendar. If the other person wrote an e-mail in the chat, the panel offers to invite it (you see the address before Y; the server only accepts addresses that appear in that chat), with a Meet link. No e-mail yet? One click adds "Me passa seu e-mail que te mando o convite?" to the reply, and when they answer with it the chat shows "Adicionar <e-mail> no convite": your Claude adds them to the same event (only the update-event tool allowed). zapzero holds no calendar credentials. Settings: `ZAP_CLAUDE`, `ZAP_CALENDAR_TOOL`, `ZAP_AGENT_MODEL`.
- **Use it from Claude.** `bun run setup` links a Claude Code skill: ask Claude "who's waiting on me?", "how fast did I answer this month?" or "I live in Rio, fix my profile", and it calls zapzero locally through `bun run zap api …`. No MCP server or token to configure (there is a local one too, below).
- **Keyboard flow:** `Y` reply · `E` edit · `R` new draft · `D` resolved · `A` archive · `S` skip · `I` ignore this person forever · `J`/`K` move · `Z` undo · `⌘↵` reply from the editor.
- **Runs in the background**, re-reading WhatsApp every 15 minutes and only re-doing AI work for chats that changed.

The panel is in Portuguese or English (setup asks).

## Requirements

- macOS with [WhatsApp Desktop](https://www.whatsapp.com/download) linked to your phone. Linking syncs about the last 3 months of messages; older chats show in the list without text.
- [Bun](https://bun.com) 1.3+.
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), logged in. zapzero runs it headless (`claude -p`, no tools, no MCP) and your Claude subscription pays for triage, drafts, rewrites, profile and suggestions. Nothing else to pay or configure.
- Or a local model with [Ollama](https://ollama.com): nothing leaves your Mac. Setup asks which AI to use, and the panel language (Portuguese or English).
- Optional: an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) key. It unlocks Jev (`typesafe/jev-1.14`) for triage: faster than batching through Claude and about US$0.00005 per chat (US$0.09 to triage 1,600 chats). Without Claude Code, OpenRouter also runs the chat model (`ZAP_LLM=openrouter`).

## Install

### The app

[Download zapzero for Mac](https://github.com/vibegui/zapzero/releases/latest/download/zapzero-mac.dmg) (Apple Silicon), drag it to Applications and open it. It isn't signed by Apple yet: the first time, go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**. Then give **zapzero** Full Disk Access (same pane, Full Disk Access) and open it again.

The app starts zapzero's server on your Mac (`desktop/`, Tauri; the server is a `bun build --compile` sidecar) and shows the panel in a window. Quitting the app stops the server. If the launchd server from `bun run setup` is running, the app uses it. Build it yourself with `bun run desktop`.

### From the terminal

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vibegui/zapzero && cd zapzero
bun install
cp .env.example .env        # optional: your OpenRouter key, for Jev
bun run setup
```

`setup` checks everything, takes the first snapshot, builds the panel, installs a launchd agent (`dev.zapzero.server`) so the server starts at login, and prints the panel URL with your access token.

macOS blocks other apps' data until you allow it. If setup says it can't read WhatsApp's database: **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access**, add your terminal, then run it again. The background server is its own binary (`~/Library/Application Support/zap/bin/zapzero`), built once by setup: give Full Disk Access to that one, not to `bun`, so no other script gets it. Updates don't rebuild it, so the permission stays.

## Use

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8810/?t=<token>` (the token is in `$ZAP_DATA/token`). Then:

1. Check **Seu jeito** in the sidebar: accept or edit who you are and how you write.
2. Start at **Importante ou urgente**: `Y`, `Y`, `Y`, `E`, `Y`.
3. Press `I` on people you never want to see again.

From your phone or another computer, put it on your private [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) network (never Funnel):

```sh
tailscale serve --bg --set-path=/zap http://127.0.0.1:8810
```

### Connect your Claude (local MCP)

zapzero serves an MCP at `http://127.0.0.1:8810/mcp`, on your Mac only, behind the panel's token. **Connect to Claude** in the panel's footer copies the command:

```sh
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http zapzero http://127.0.0.1:8810/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"     # token: ~/Library/Application Support/zap/token
```

Tools: `inbox`, `chat`, `stats`, `decide` (done, skip, archive, ignore: only zapzero's own list), `undo`, `refresh`. None of them sends anything. The `panel` tool also serves the panel as an [MCP App](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps) screen for hosts on this Mac.

### Commands

```sh
bun run zap refresh     # snapshot -> triage -> drafts, once
bun run zap inbox       # counts per category
bun run zap voice       # re-read how you write
bun run zap suggest     # suggest new areas now
bun run zap stats       # answer performance as JSON
bun run zap api inbox   # any API route, token handled (POST: bun run zap api <route> '<json>')
bun run start           # build + serve in the foreground (instead of launchd)
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/dev.zapzero.server   # restart the agent after updating
```

Settings live in `.env` (see `.env.example`): models, port, refresh interval, data dir.

### Uninstall

```sh
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/dev.zapzero.server
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.zapzero.server.plist ~/.claude/skills/zapzero
rm -r ~/Library/Application\ Support/zap    # your snapshots, drafts and decisions
```

## How it works

```
WhatsApp Desktop's SQLite ──read-only copy──▶ snapshot (every 15 min)
                                                   │
             Jev: wait / urgency / who / area ◀────┤  only chats whose last message changed
     chat model: draft in your voice, areas ◀──────┘
                                                   │
         panel (React) ◀── Hono API on 127.0.0.1, token-gated ──▶ `open whatsapp://send?…` (you press Enter)
```

- `server/wa.ts` reads the snapshot. `server/ai.ts` holds every paid call, each capped per run in items and dollars, and stopped when the upstream fails. `server/inbox.ts` is the pure ranking (tested). `server/store.ts` is zapzero's own SQLite.
- `web/` is the panel: React, TanStack Router + Query, Tailwind.
- `site/` is the landing page at [zapzero.dev](https://zapzero.dev) (TanStack Start + deco blocks).
- `skills/zapzero/SKILL.md` teaches an agent to call zapzero (`zap api …`) or read the database directly. `server/stats.ts` is the pure performance math (tested).

### Development

```sh
bun run dev      # API on :8810 + Vite on :5188 with HMR
bun test && bun run check && bunx biome check --write .
```

## The local database (WhatsApp Mac, 2026)

`~/Library/Group Containers/group.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp.shared/`

Encoding details:

- **Session type:** 0 = DM, 1 = group, 2 = broadcast, 3 = status, 4 = community group, 5 = channel.
- **Dates:** Cocoa epoch, so add `978307200`.
- **Pinned chats:** `ZLASTMESSAGEDATE` sits in the far future (> 4e9). Use the date of `ZLASTMESSAGE` instead.
- **Message types with content:** `0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,15` (text, image, video, audio, contact, location, link, document, sticker). `ZGROUPEVENTTYPE=2` is the default and does not mean an event.
- **History:** linking the desktop app only syncs about the last 3 months of messages. The chat list (name, last date, unread count) is complete, but older chats have no text to read.
