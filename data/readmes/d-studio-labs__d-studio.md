# D-Studio

[![CI](https://github.com/d-studio-labs/d-studio/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/d-studio-labs/d-studio/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Strudel without the browser. Your own editor is the source of truth,
SuperDirt makes the sound, Node schedules it in real time.

```
your editor ──:w──▶ d-studio play ──OSC──▶ SuperDirt   (hot-swaps the pattern, clock keeps running)
```

This repo is the **framework**: the engine, the composition helpers, and the
SuperDirt orchestration. Your music — tracks, your own synths, samples — lives
in your own project, which depends on this as a package, like any other npm
dependency.

## Status

Early, but public and usable today. `@d-studio-labs/core` and
`@d-studio-labs/synths` are published to GitHub Packages (not the public npm
registry) — real, tagged, installable dependencies (see "Make your own"
below) — using them doesn't require this monorepo. `examples/playground` is
a real consumer of it too (not a copy of its code) and is the best place to
see the intended shape of a project that depends on it.

GitHub Packages requires auth even to install a public package: create a
token with the `read:packages` scope
(https://github.com/settings/tokens), `export NPM_TOKEN=<it>`, and the
scaffolded project's `.npmrc` picks it up automatically.

## Make your own

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-studio-labs/d-studio/main/packages/create/create.sh | sh -s my-track
```

One command, nothing to clone first — just `curl`, `tar`, `sed` and `npm` on
your machine. Leave off `-s my-track` and it prompts for a name instead
(only when run from a terminal — a name is required in a non-interactive
context like CI).

What it does: downloads `packages/create/templates/project/` from this
repo's `main` branch, fills in the project name everywhere it appears, fills
in your git `user.name` and the current year into `LICENSE`, then runs `npm
install`. Refuses to run if a directory with that name already exists.

What you get: `my-track/` matching the shape in
["A project that depends on it"](#a-project-that-depends-on-it) below —
ESLint/Prettier already wired up, an all-rights-reserved `LICENSE` to swap
out if you want something more permissive, and two starter tracks:
`tracks/hello/` (minimal, delete once you've got the hang of it) and
`tracks/velvet/` (a fuller, fully-arranged example — see its own README).
`tracks/.default` is set to `velvet`, so a bare `npm run play` plays that
one.

It finishes by printing the same one-time setup as
[Try it](#try-it-examplesplayground) below:

```
cd my-track
npm run dirt-install   # one-time: SuperCollider quarks (needs SuperCollider installed)
npm run samples        # download drum machine samples
npm run dirt           # boot SuperDirt; wait for "SUPERDIRT READY"
npm run play           # (in another terminal) start the clock
```

**Maintaining the template:** `tracks/hello/`, `tracks/velvet/` and
`synths/d-studio.scd` in the template are hand-copies of the same files in
`examples/playground` (the source of truth for both). Edit a track in
`examples/playground`, then run `packages/create/sync.sh` from the repo
root to copy those changes into the template before publishing — it leaves
template-only files (`tracks/velvet/README.md`, the template's own
`package.json`/`LICENSE`) alone, and doesn't delete anything, so check `git
status` after if you removed a file on the playground side.

## Try it: `examples/playground`

Prefer to poke at a working example inside this repo first? The fastest way
to hear the engine, from inside this monorepo:

```sh
npm install                      # from the repo root, once
d-studio dirt-install             # one-time: SuperDirt + Dirt-Samples quarks
cd examples/playground
npm run samples                  # download drum machine samples (909 + 808)
npm run dirt                     # boots SuperDirt; wait for "SUPERDIRT READY"
```

In a second terminal:

```sh
cd examples/playground
npm run play                     # starts the clock, plays tracks/velvet (its tracks/.default)
```

Open any file `tracks/velvet/index.js` imports and save — the pattern
hot-swaps while `play` keeps running, the clock never stops. Try
muting/unmuting a line in its `parts` object, or nudging a `.gain()`/`.lpf()`
value, and listen to it change live. There's also `tracks/hello/`, a
minimal two-part example — play it with `npm run play -- hello`.

Other commands, run from inside `examples/playground/` (the same ones listed
under [The CLI](#the-cli) below, scoped to this one project):

```sh
npm run check                     # parses every part, prints events — no audio needed
npm run export -- velvet          # renders to exports/velvet.wav
npm run test -- velvet --from 32  # flags any part that's effectively silent
npm run display                   # lanes + playhead in the browser
```

## Packages

```
packages/
  core/        @d-studio-labs/core — engine, lib, superdirt (see below)
  synths/      @d-studio-labs/synths — the shared filter-envelope SynthDef (d-modules.scd)
  create/      the project scaffolder (curl | sh) — not published, just a script + template
examples/
  playground/  a minimal project that depends on @d-studio-labs/core
```

`@d-studio-labs/synths` is a sibling package under the same npm scope, not a
subpath of `core` — `core`'s `startup.scd` loads it via a relative path
(`../../synths`) that resolves the same way whether you're in this monorepo
or a real install, since both put same-scope packages side by side under
`node_modules/@d-studio-labs/`.

## A project that depends on it

```
my-music/
  package.json       ← "@d-studio-labs/core" as a dependency
  tracks/.default      ← optional: one line, which track `play`/`check` default to
  tracks/<name>/      ← index.js (BPM, parts) + the parts' own files
  synths/*.scd        ← optional: your own SuperDirt synths, loaded after the engine's
  samples/            ← gitignored, from `d-studio samples`
  exports/            ← gitignored, from `d-studio export`
```

`examples/playground` is exactly this shape — read it before writing your
own, or see ["Make your own"](#make-your-own) above to generate it.

## Dependencies

**npm** (installed automatically as dependencies of `@d-studio-labs/core`):

- `@strudel/core`, `@strudel/mini` — the pattern language
- `@julusian/midi` — MIDI controller I/O

**Not npm-installable — set up once on your machine:**

- [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) (`brew install --cask supercollider`, then open it once for Gatekeeper)
- SuperDirt + Dirt-Samples quarks, one time: `d-studio dirt-install`
- Optional: **sc3-plugins** (extra SuperDirt UGens) and **ATK** (`Quarks.install("atk-sc3")`, for the ambisonic/binaural echoes — without it, `DIRT_SPACE` falls back to `off`)

Boot it before `d-studio play`/`ping`/`export`: `d-studio dirt` — wait for `SUPERDIRT READY`.

## The CLI

Once `@d-studio-labs/core` is a dependency, its `d-studio` binary is on your
project's `node_modules/.bin`:

```sh
npm install
d-studio check            # headless: parses every part, prints events per cycle (no audio)
d-studio check -- velvet  # just one track
d-studio play             # the engine: Strudel's scheduler in Node → timed OSC to SuperDirt
d-studio play -- velvet --from 0 --to 16   # loop a bar range
d-studio export -- velvet  # render a track to exports/*.wav
d-studio samples          # download drum machine samples (909 + 808 by default)
d-studio ping             # one sound over OSC, no Strudel: is SuperDirt listening?
d-studio dirt             # boots SuperDirt headless; wait for "SUPERDIRT READY"
d-studio dirt-install     # one-time: SuperDirt + Dirt-Samples quarks
d-studio test -- velvet --from 32   # solo-renders each part, flags any effectively silent one
                                     # (for an arranged track, point --from at a section where
                                     # every part should be active — not bar 0, which may be a
                                     # quiet intro by design)
d-studio display          # lanes + playhead in the browser, following d-studio play's clock
```

`d-studio play`/`check` with no track named use `tracks/.default` (one line,
a track's folder name) if the project has one, else whichever track folder
sorts first alphabetically.

Each one needs SuperDirt running (see Dependencies, above) except `check`,
which needs nothing but Node.

## `@d-studio-labs/core`'s exports

| Subpath                       | What                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@d-studio-labs/core/mod`     | `drift` (perlin), `sweep` (sine), `ramp`, `gate`                                      |
| `@d-studio-labs/core/arrange` | `arrangement(bars)` → `during(…ranges)`, `env(…points)`, `fadeIn`/`fadeOut`           |
| `@d-studio-labs/core/fx`      | echo times, `evolvingFilter`, `dubSpace`, `dubChord`, delay & spring params           |
| `@d-studio-labs/core/drums`   | `heartbeat(root)` — a dark kick tuned to the track's root                             |
| `@d-studio-labs/core/space`   | ambisonic params: `space`, `sphere`, `width`, `roll`, `azim`, `spin`, `elev`, `glide` |
| `@d-studio-labs/core/midi`    | `midi(part)`, `cc(n)`, `knob(i)`, `around(i, low, high)`, `controls(parts, map)`      |

A track is a folder with an `index.js` exporting `BPM`, optional `BARS`, and
`parts` (each key one lane). Saving any file a track imports hot-swaps the
pattern while `d-studio play` runs. See `examples/playground/tracks/velvet/index.js`.

## Layout

```
packages/core/
  engine/       the runtime: scheduling, MIDI in, OSC out, export, the CLI (cli.mjs)
  lib/          composition helpers tracks import (table above)
  superdirt/    startup, master (glue/tape/limiter), space (ATK), spring, midi, record
packages/synths/
  d-modules.scd the shared filter-envelope SynthDef, loaded by core's startup.scd
packages/create/
  create.sh     the scaffolder (see "Make your own" above)
  sync.sh       copies tracks/{hello,velvet} + synths/d-studio.scd from
                examples/playground (source of truth) into templates/project/ —
                run after editing a track there, before testing/publishing
  templates/project/   what it copies — a full standalone project, own package.json
```
