# Kavero

**From product data to beautiful experiences.**

Kavero is an AI-native catalog and presentation builder. Bring your products — pasted, imported from any MCP server, or generated with AI — design them in a visual slide editor, animate them, and publish the same catalog as a **PDF**, an editable **PowerPoint**, **JPG images**, an **MP4 video**, a **single HTML file** or an **animated website**.

It's local-first: open it and start working, no account needed. Sign in to sync across devices, collaborate in workspaces, publish, and let AI agents build catalogs for you over MCP.

## Highlights

- **Visual editor** — text, images, shapes, product cards and grids, HTML blocks; snapping, groups, layers, undo/redo, autosave, and a PowerPoint-style Morph transition that moves shared elements between slides.
- **AI chat, generation and editing** — start from a prompt on the home page, or chat with your model inside the editor: it knows the open catalog, remembers each catalog's conversation, and proposes slide edits you approve with a before/after preview. Built on the Vercel AI SDK. Works with Anthropic Claude, OpenRouter, OpenAI or local models — set on the server, or by each user with their own key in Settings → AI. A built-in planner takes over when no model is configured.
- **MCP both ways** — import products from your store's MCP server; let Claude and other agents create, edit, preview, export and publish catalogs through Kavero's MCP server (29 tools incl. fonts, scoped tokens, audit log).
- **Motion** — element animations and slide transitions that play the same in preview, on websites and in video.
- **Every format from one document** — PDF with selectable text, PowerPoint with editable objects, MP4 up to 4K, JPG slide images in a zip, published websites with SEO and social previews, or a single self-contained HTML file to host anywhere.
- **Example presentations** for Kavero and its sister projects (OpenRive, Upstand, dgrunner) on every fresh dashboard — open one to see Morph, animations and themes in action.
- **12 templates** for fashion, jewelry, electronics, furniture, cosmetics, food, real estate, industrial, automotive and general catalogs.
- **Right-to-left** catalogs (Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu) with per-paragraph direction.
- **Desktop app** — install on Windows, macOS or Linux and work fully offline: an embedded database, no sign-in, a local MCP endpoint for your AI agents, and in-app updates from GitHub Releases.
- **Teams** — workspaces with owner, admin, editor and viewer roles.
- **Server admin** — the first account is the admin: manage users and roles, suspend accounts, moderate published sites, choose open, invite-only or closed sign-ups, and review the activity log.

## Quick start

Requirements: [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.4.2+ and Docker with Compose (for Postgres and Redis). Chrome or Chromium is needed for PDF/video export.

```bash
bun run setup  # install dependencies, create local config, start Postgres and apply migrations
bun dev        # start the web app and API server at http://localhost:3001
```

The setup command creates `apps/web/.env` from the example and generates a local `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` if it is blank. It keeps an existing `.env` and only fills in a blank secret. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to give everyone an AI model, or let each user add their own Claude/OpenRouter key in Settings → AI. For desktop development, use `bun run dev:desktop`.

Everything runs in one container too: `docker compose up -d --build` (see [deployment](docs/deployment.md)).
