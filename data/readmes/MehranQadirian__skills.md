## Quick start

1. Open a category and pick a skill.
2. **Claude.ai:** zip the skill folder and upload it in Settings > Capabilities > Skills.
3. **Claude Code:** copy the skill folder into `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Layout

```
skills/
├── scripts/validate_skills.py
└── <category>/
    ├── README.md
    └── <skill>/
        ├── SKILL.md          instructions for Claude
        ├── README.md         instructions for humans
        ├── scripts/          optional, tested helper scripts
        ├── references/       optional, details loaded only when needed
        └── templates/        optional, files to copy and fill
```

Every skill has a `SKILL.md` and a `README.md`. Keep `SKILL.md` short and move detail into `references/`.

## Contributing

Add your skill under the right category, link it in that category's README, and open a pull request.

Before you commit, run the checker:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_skills.py
```

It verifies the folder name matches the `name` in the frontmatter, each skill has a README, the category README links the skill, and relative links resolve.
