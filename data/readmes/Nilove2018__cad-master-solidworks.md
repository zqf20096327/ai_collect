CAD Master is a SOLIDWORKS add-in that runs the official **Claude Code** in a task pane next to your model. You talk to it like a design engineer: "a 500 ml water bottle with a screw cap", or drop a photo and say "make this". Claude plans the design, you approve it, and then Claude builds every part in SOLIDWORKS and checks each step.

It follows the open **[solidworks-api skill](https://github.com/Nilove2018/solidworks-api-skill)**, a set of verified API rules and design lessons from real product builds. That's how it builds correct parametric parts, mated assemblies and toleranced drawings instead of guessing.

> **Status: pre-release.** It works and is in daily use, but there is no installer yet. You build it from source (below). The one-click installer, automatic updates and first-run setup are planned for **v1.0**: see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## What you get
- **A chat written for designers, not programmers.**
  - While Claude works, one line with turning gears says what it is doing in design terms, for example *"Revolving the body · step 3 of 8"*.
  - A *hands off* tag shows while it drives SOLIDWORKS.
  - Every answer ends with the latest model view.
  - Commands and scripts stay out of the way in a separate **Details** tab.
- **Plan first.** For anything bigger than a question, Claude studies the model, asks what's unclear and shows a numbered plan. You choose:
  - **Approve, Claude builds it all**: Bypass mode; Claude makes the remaining decisions and lists its assumptions at the end.
  - **Approve, I confirm each run**.
  - **Keep planning**.
- **Tasks tab**: the approved plan becomes a live checklist that ticks off as each step is built *and verified*.
- **Drag and drop**:
  - Drop pictures, sketches, STEP/IGES/STL/SOLIDWORKS files or PDFs onto the panel.
  - Drag finished files and model views out to Explorer or an email.
- **Ribbon tab and Tools menu**: New Design Brief, Ask About Selection, Send View, Review Model, Make Drawing, Run Checks, Export STEP/STL and more.
- **Live SOLIDWORKS tools for Claude** (a local MCP server, localhost only, with a per-session token):
  - active document, selection, feature tree
  - **screenshots of the viewport**: Claude looks before it says something is right
  - rebuild and What's Wrong checks, mass and custom properties
  - in-process macros, which always ask first
- **Modes, models and effort**:
  - modes: Plan, Ask, Accept edits, Auto, Bypass
  - any Claude model
  - effort up to **Ultracode**
- **Terminal tab**: the full interactive Claude Code, with every slash command.
- **History**: resume any earlier chat.
- **Workflows** as slash commands: `/cad:plan`, `/cad:review`, `/cad:check`, `/cad:drawing`, `/cad:export`, `/cad:testrun` and `/cad:lessons`. The last one turns a finished project's failures and successes into general rules for the skill.

## Requirements
| | |
|---|---|
| Windows | 10 or 11, 64-bit |
| SOLIDWORKS | 2025 (other versions are not tested yet) |
| Claude | A Claude account: Pro, Max, Team or Enterprise, or an Anthropic Console account. Each user signs in with **their own** account |
| Claude Code | Installed automatically from the panel if missing (official installer) |
| Python | 3.9+ with `pywin32`, used by Claude's build scripts |
| WebView2 Runtime | Part of Windows 11; [download](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/) for Windows 10 |

## Install (from source)
1. Install the [solidworks-api skill](https://github.com/Nilove2018/solidworks-api-skill#install).
2. Clone this repo and build it. You don't need Visual Studio: the script downloads the C# compiler and the WebView2 SDK, and takes the SOLIDWORKS interop files from your SOLIDWORKS install.
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Nilove2018/cad-master-solidworks.git
   cd cad-master-solidworks
   .\build.ps1
   ```
3. Register the add-in. Windows asks once for administrator rights.
   ```powershell
   .\install.ps1
   ```
4. Start SOLIDWORKS. CAD Master loads automatically (*Tools > Add-Ins > CAD Master*). Open it from the **CAD Master** ribbon tab, or the owl icon in the task pane.

To remove it, run `.\uninstall.ps1`.

## Using it
1. **Sign in.** The panel shows a welcome screen until you're signed in. *Sign in with Claude* runs Claude Code's own `claude auth login` in your browser. CAD Master never sees your password or tokens.
2. **Describe what you want**, in Plan mode (the default for new designs). Add sizes, material and process if you know them, or use **New Design Brief** on the ribbon.
3. **Approve the plan.** Then watch the gears line and the Tasks tab. Don't click in the model while the *hands off* tag shows.
4. **Get the files.** Results appear as file chips. Click one to open it in SOLIDWORKS, or drag it out.

Tips:
- **Shift+Tab** cycles modes.
- **/** opens commands.
- **Esc** stops Claude.
- The pop-out button gives a bigger window.

## Privacy
- Your conversation goes from Claude Code to Anthropic, exactly as when you use Claude Code in a terminal, under your own account and Anthropic's terms.
- CAD Master itself sends nothing anywhere. Its tool server listens only on `localhost`, with a random token per session.
- Settings, logs and chat history stay on your PC, in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CADMaster` and `~\.claude`.

The planned opt-in lesson sharing is described in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md). It is off unless you turn it on, and it never sends designs or files.

## How it works
```
SOLIDWORKS ── CAD Master add-in (C#, .NET 4.8)
                ├─ task pane: WebView2 panel (ui/)
                ├─ Claude Code, headless (stream-json) ── Anthropic
                │     ├─ system prompt + cad plugin (plugin/cad)
                │     └─ solidworks-api skill
                ├─ MCP server on localhost: sw_status, sw_screenshot, sw_check, …
                └─ Claude's Python build scripts attach to THIS SOLIDWORKS by process ID
```
- The add-in starts Claude Code with your account and adds a system prompt. That prompt:
  - makes Claude talk like a mechanical design engineer
  - follows the skill (test runs, parameter tables, staged builds and checks)
  - never closes or overwrites your documents
- Build scripts use the skill's `swlib`. Inside CAD Master it attaches to the SOLIDWORKS that hosts the panel and never starts a second, hidden one.
- The panel starts only after SOLIDWORKS has finished starting up, and it never calls SOLIDWORKS from inside SOLIDWORKS event handlers. Both are lessons from real crashes.

## Repository structure
| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/CADMaster/` | The add-in (C#, .NET Framework 4.8), in these folders: `AddIn/` ribbon and task pane; `Claude/` Claude Code sessions and history; `Mcp/` and `Sw/` the SOLIDWORKS tools; `Terminal/` the ConPTY terminal; `Ui/` the WebView2 host |
| `src/TestHost/` | The same panel in its own window, attached to a running SOLIDWORKS (for development) |
| `ui/` | The panel (HTML/CSS/JS). Opened in a normal browser, it runs against a built-in mock |
| `plugin/cad/` | Claude Code plugin: system prompt, `/cad:*` commands, `cad-reviewer` agent |
| `python/` | `cadmaster_sw.py`: attach to the hosting SOLIDWORKS by process ID |
| `icons/`, `assets/` | Ribbon and task-pane icons, logo |
| `tools/` | `fetch-deps.ps1` (compiler and WebView2 SDK), icon generator |
| `tests/` | DevTools-protocol UI tests (`cdp.js`) and the Claude Code protocol spike |
| `docs/` | Maintainer docs, for example the prompt that applies lessons to the skill |
| `build.ps1`, `install.ps1`, `uninstall.ps1` | Build, register, unregister |

## Troubleshooting
- **SOLIDWORKS closes straight away when you start it.** A hidden SOLIDWORKS with no window is still running, so the new launch hands over to it. SOLIDWORKS Rx shows "A process sldworks.exe is currently running". End `SLDWORKS.exe` in Task Manager and start again.
- **SOLIDWORKS crashes on every start after an earlier crash.** It may be trying to recover a half-written file. Move the files out of `%TEMP%\SWBackupDirectory\swxauto*` and start again.
- **Panel blank, or "couldn't start its browser view".** Check `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CADMaster\logs`. The WebView2 Runtime must be installed.
- **"Claude Code stopped".** The Details tab has the message. Run `claude auth status` in the Terminal tab.
- **Build says the DLL is in use.** Close SOLIDWORKS (and the test host) first.
