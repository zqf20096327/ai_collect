# Literally.dev AEO

Measure how AI assistants answer the questions your buyers ask: whether they
mention you, cite you, and who they recommend instead. `literally-aeo` runs
the audit on your own machine with your own provider keys, and writes a
portable evidence bundle that anyone can verify offline.

## Ask Claude to run this for you

You don't need to be a developer. Open Claude Code (the terminal app, or
the Code tab of the Claude desktop app) and paste:

> Run an AEO audit for acme.example with github.com/literallydotdev/aeo.
> Install it and follow `literally-aeo guide`.

Claude installs what is missing, asks a few questions about your company,
and asks you to approve an amount before anything is spent; the run cannot
spend more than that. You paste your provider keys into a file in your own
editor, never into the chat. `literally-aeo guide` prints the protocol
Claude follows, checkpoint by checkpoint.

## Run it yourself

```sh
npm install -g literally-aeo
literally-aeo init                       # audit.json and .env.example
literally-aeo doctor --env-file .env     # what a run needs, checked offline
literally-aeo plan                       # what a run would measure, and its estimated cost
literally-aeo run --env-file .env --max-usd 50   # measure under a cap; run again to resume
literally-aeo status audit-run           # phase, answers and spend, read-only
literally-aeo view audit-run             # local, loopback-only viewer
literally-aeo export audit-run           # a deterministic .aeo.zip bundle
literally-aeo verify audit-run.aeo.zip   # offline verification
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 or newer on Linux, where it is tested. macOS (Apple silicon)
  is expected to work but is not tested in CI. Windows users run it under
  WSL 2.
- Nothing else for the analysis and writing stages: the
  [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) that runs them is a pinned
  dependency of the package.
- An `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` (Vercel AI Gateway) for the assistant answers and
  the host model calls, and a DataForSEO login for Google AI Overviews and
  factual grounding searches.
- For coding-agent surfaces, the CLI of each one you measure (Claude Code,
  Codex, Cursor) and its own login.
- For `moneyPages`, Playwright's Chromium, which renders each page for the
  renderability check (`literally-aeo doctor` names the install command).
  Money pages must be public https pages on the brand's site or its
  subdomains; a page on another host needs that host in
  `runPolicy.checkHosts`, at most 20 of each. Every request the site checks
  make, the browser's included, goes only to public addresses.

## Model and cost

One model judges the answers, researches the claims and writes the report:
`"model"` in `audit.json`, a gateway model ID. Leave it out to use the
recommended model, the strongest the engine supports, because judgment and
writing quality are the report. `literally-aeo doctor` lists the supported
models with their list prices and refuses any other. The assistants being
measured keep their own pinned models; they are what the audit observes.

`literally-aeo plan` estimates what a run costs, as a range per kind of
work: the assistant answers, the analysis stages, the other model calls and
the searches. A run does not start without a cap you approve
(`--max-usd`), and the cap covers all of that work: the run stops,
resumable, before a call would cross it. A run keeps its model and its cap;
`rejudge --model` judges the same answers with another model in a new run
directory.

Nothing is sent to Literally.dev: no telemetry, no account, no upload.
A run contacts only the providers you configure and the sites it checks.

## How deep each question goes

By default each question is asked twice on every assistant, and once on
Google AI Overviews. To measure fewer questions more deeply, set the depth
in `audit.json`:

```json
"chatProbes": { "runsPerPrompt": 12 },
"agentProbes": { "runsPerPrompt": 12 }
```

`chatProbes` covers the chat assistants, AI Overviews included, and
`agentProbes` the coding agents; each takes 1 to 25 runs per question.
`literally-aeo plan` shows the answers and the cost a depth plans before
anything is spent. Depth is part of what a run measures, so keep it the
same across the runs you mean to compare: a progress comparison between
runs at different depths reports that the scope changed, not a change in
visibility.

## What a run produces

A run directory holds the captured answers, every judgment, the computed
metrics, the report copy and a hash-chained journal of every operation the
host observed: each probe attempt, each model call with its exact request
and response, each research search and fetch, each technical check, and each
Codex session. `export` turns it into a `.aeo.zip` bundle; `verify`
recomputes the metrics from the bundled judgments, checks every hash and the
journal chain, and states plainly what it could not check. Verify a bundle
with the release that exported it or a newer one: an older release reports
a bundle format it cannot read as unsupported (exit 2) instead of checking
it.

Verification proves the bundle is internally consistent and unaltered since
export. It cannot prove that a provider really returned an answer: the bundle
is evidence its producer recorded, not a third-party attestation.

## As a library

The command is the supported interface, along with `literally-aeo/contracts`
(the report and measurement schemas). Every other module is importable by its
path, for example `literally-aeo/bundle/verify`, because Literally.dev's
hosted service runs this same engine. Those paths are internal: they can
change in any release, so pin an exact version if you use them.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test          # deterministic and free; *.live.spec.ts files are not run
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm cli plan      # the CLI from source
pnpm build         # dist/ and resources/, as the package ships them
```

Releases publish from this repository's `release.yml` when a `vX.Y.Z` tag is
pushed. The version lives in `package.json` and in `toolVersion`
(`src/bundle/contracts.ts`), which every journal and bundle records; the
build refuses a mismatch.
