An **Ollama metrics exporter** for Prometheus and OpenTelemetry. ollametry is a
transparent reverse proxy for [Ollama](https://ollama.com) that measures token
usage, latency, time to first token and decode speed per model, error rates,
and the models Ollama holds in memory. Metrics follow the OpenTelemetry
[GenAI semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/)
and leave two ways, with a ready-made Grafana dashboard for either:

- **Prometheus scrape**: `/metrics` on `:11436`, for any Prometheus-compatible
  scraper ([Prometheus exporter](docs/prometheus.md)).
- **OTLP push**: to [`grafana/otel-lgtm`](https://github.com/grafana/docker-otel-lgtm)
  (`~/opt/grafana`) or any OpenTelemetry backend.

Ollama has no metrics endpoint, so ollametry sits in front of it and reads the
usage statistics Ollama already returns in every response. Requests and
responses pass through byte for byte, streaming included.

## Platforms

ollametry runs in a container (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) next to Ollama on
the host, with Docker Compose (`make up`) on any OS:

| OS | Docker | Ollama |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | [Docker Desktop](docs/containers.md#macos-docker-desktop) | On the host |
| Linux | [Docker Engine](docs/containers.md#linux-docker-engine) | On the host; on native Linux (not a VM) also in a container with an NVIDIA or AMD GPU |
| Windows | [WSL 2](docs/containers.md#windows-wsl-2) with Docker Desktop or Docker Engine | On the host |

Ollama runs on the host everywhere except native Linux: on macOS and Windows
containers run inside a VM, away from the GPU
([GPU access](docs/containers.md#where-ollama-runs-gpu-access)).

## Quick start

This repository's setup runs ollametry with Docker Compose next to the
`~/opt/grafana` stack (Docker Compose v2.24+, `make`, `curl`, `bash`; on
Windows, from WSL 2). To run a published image instead of building one, see
[install](docs/install.md#using-a-published-image).

```sh
make up                               # docker compose up -d --build, wait until healthy
make health                           # Ollama, the proxy, readiness
make smoke MODEL=granite4.2:8b        # one request through the proxy
make -C ~/opt/grafana dashboards      # provision the dashboard into Grafana
```

Then point clients at `http://127.0.0.1:11435` instead of `:11434`
([more clients](docs/clients.md)):

```sh
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11435 ollama run granite4.2:8b
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11435/v1
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11435
```

```powershell
$env:OLLAMA_HOST = "127.0.0.1:11435"; ollama run granite4.2:8b
$env:OPENAI_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:11435/v1"
$env:ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:11435"
```

Prometheus can scrape `http://127.0.0.1:11436/metrics`, and with the Compose
setup the dashboard is at `https://grafana.localhost/d/ollametry` (folder
"ollama"). `make logs` follows the logs, `make down` stops everything, and
`make help` lists every target.

## Supported APIs

| API | Endpoints | Streaming |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ollama native | `/api/generate`, `/api/chat`, `/api/embed`, `/api/embeddings` | NDJSON |
