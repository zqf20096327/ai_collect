![AiPASS Desktop window in light theme: sessions and project files on the left, conversation with tool rows in the center, composer with mode, provider, model and effort at the bottom](./public/screenshots/desktop-light.png)

<p align="center">
  <em>Light theme. Sessions and the project tree are on the left, the conversation is in the middle, and every tool call is a row you can open. Pending edits appear in a separate panel with per-file checkboxes and diff view.</em>
</p>

### Quick start (30 seconds)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kasemjeff/aipass-desktop.git
cd aipass-desktop
npm run setup     # Node check, token, PATH, bridge, browser pages
npm run desktop   # opens the window at http://127.0.0.1:8790
```

Then load the extension once (`chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked → `aipass-bridge/extension`) and paste the token into the popup. Full steps under [Installing](#installing).

**Who this fits:** Thai-first users on Windows who want a file-editing agent they can watch, approve and resume. **Who it does not fit (yet):** anyone who needs a signed macOS/Linux installer today — those builds are ready-to-try, not ready-to-ship. Running the window in a browser works on all three OSs today.

## What this repo is

aipass is two layers, and it matters which is which.

**Our work — the desktop window and the harness.** This is the product.

- **`desktop/`** — the window: projects, a chat list, transcripts that resume
  and fork, per-file diff approval, plan cards, permission modes, a file panel,
  playbooks, plugins. Thai-first, dark and light.
- **`aipass-bridge/harness/`** — the agent core: the run loop, the file tools,
  the marker protocol, sessions on disk, the compaction budget, permissions and
  path rules, the WAF, providers, plugins, MCP. The window drives the harness;
  the VS Code panel in
  [`ide-extension/`](./ide-extension/README.md) drives the same backend — the
  surfaces cannot drift apart.

**The bridge and the Chrome extension are upstream, and we extend
them.** They started life as
**[niawjunior/aipass-bridge](https://github.com/niawjunior/aipass-bridge)** by
[niawjunior](https://github.com/niawjunior) — an MIT-licensed project this
repository continues. That code stays under niawjunior's copyright, credited in
[LICENSE](./LICENSE). Here we keep it running, extend it where the harness
needs more of it (loopback auth, the WAF table, the provider contract, the
doctor), and stay compatible with it. The bridge is the transport; the harness
is the product.

One settings file — `~/.aipass/settings.json` — is shared by the window, the
CLI and the agent, so a change is true everywhere immediately.

Influences beyond that: the session storage borrows its JSONL-per-session shape
from the pi coding agent, and the permission/hook vocabulary and the
tool-writing guidance (token-efficient results, head+tail clipping) follow the
published agent-tool literature. Those are influences on the design, not code
taken from anywhere.

## What this repo does well

These are the parts worth having. Each one is a decision the repository holds
itself to — most of them have a test that would notice if they broke.

**The agent is reviewable, not a black box.** Every tool call is a row you can
open; every pending edit is a file with a checkbox and a real diff; the plan
card shows what is done and what is not. The stop button ends the *work* — the
tool of the reply that was running, the command in flight (with its tree), the
web search, the MCP call, the run that had just started — and the window says
what the stop found, instead of going quiet.

**Nothing lands on disk without you.** The overlay is the only write surface of
a run: a dry run shows the diff and writes nothing, and an edit lands only when
you tick it. The sandbox projection lives *outside* your project, so a copy of
your source can never be committed by accident.

**It is honest about what the upstream can do.** The endpoint takes one user
message and owns the conversation history, so the harness keeps its own
session log, summarises and rotates when the context fills, and never pretends
there is a message array to manage. It works around the edge instead of
against it.

**The window and the terminal cannot drift.** One harness, one settings file
(`~/.aipass/settings.json`), one run. The window drives the harness; `aipass
agent` drives the same one; a change in the settings file is true everywhere
immediately. The tests drive both surfaces, not a mock of either.

**The credential never leaves your browser.** The request runs as ordinary page
JavaScript inside your own logged-in tab, so the site's cookie rides along by
itself — the bridge never sees it and stores nothing. The loopback token is
`0600` in your home directory, the settings file holds no secret, and even a
command's *output* is screened before it goes upstream.

**It is honest about its own quality.** `docs/MATURITY.md` names every
capability — production, experimental, not shipped, won't build — with the
evidence and the owner. The eval set carries a holdout, a safety set and
Thai/English pairs; the experiment queue records what was tried, what it cost
and what would change a decision. A capability that stops holding its criteria
is demoted, not quietly kept.

**It runs wherever a Node does.** The core has zero npm runtime dependencies and
no build step for the browser window. You still need Node 24, Chrome or Chromium,
and a logged-in de.aipass.net account. The suite is plain `node --test` and it
drives the real bridge as a subprocess with a scriptable stand-in for the
extension, so a green run means the HTTP surface works, not that a mock was
happy. CI runs Windows, macOS and Linux on Node 24.

**Thai-first, and it says so.** The reply-language policy, the Thai/English
eval pairs and a window written in Thai first — not translated into it.

No credential is stored anywhere: every request runs as ordinary page
JavaScript inside your own logged-in tab, so the site's session cookie rides
along by itself. The bridge has a loopback token of its own — see *The bridge*,
below.

## Installing

Release `v0.2.0` is published, but it contains no installer assets yet. Install
from source below; when installers are published, they will appear on
[Releases](https://github.com/kasemjeff/aipass-desktop/releases/latest). See
[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the release criteria.

### What you need

| you need | why |
|---|---|
| **Node ≥ 24** | the only requirement to run it — the app imports `node:*` builtins and nothing else |
| **Chrome** (or Chromium) | the extension is the only thing that ever touches your session |
| **A de.aipass.net account** | the site the window talks to; your logged-in browser tab *is* the credential |
| **Nothing else** | no `npm install` to run it, no build step, no database, no API key |

### One command

From a fresh clone, this is the whole machine setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kasemjeff/aipass-desktop.git
cd aipass-desktop
npm run setup
```

`setup` is idempotent — re-run it any time. It does five things, in this order:

1. **Node** — checks the version and stops if it is too old.
2. **State directory** — creates `~/.aipass/` (`0700`) and mints the loopback
   token at `~/.aipass/.token` (`0600`).
3. **Clipboard** — copies the token, so pasting it into the extension popup
   is one keystroke.
4. **Bridge** — starts it, or adopts the one already running, and waits for
   `/status` to answer.
5. **Browser** — opens `de.aipass.net/chat` and `chrome://extensions`, so the
   two one-time browser steps are in front of you.

### The two browser steps (once per browser)

1. **Load the extension** — `chrome://extensions` → **Developer mode** →
   **Load unpacked** → pick `aipass-bridge/extension`.
2. **Give it the token** — the extension popup → **Advanced** → **Loopback
   token** → paste the contents of `~/.aipass/.token` → save. Then open
   <https://de.aipass.net/chat>, log in, and leave the tab open: that tab is
   what does the talking.

The bridge's `/status` answers where you are; the window's header shows the
same.

### The native app

The window runs in any browser today — `npm run desktop` serves it on
`127.0.0.1:8790`. For the real window (tray, native menu, an installer):

```bash
npm run desktop:build   # NSIS on Windows, .app/.dmg on macOS, deb/appimage on Linux
```

The packaged build carries the Node runtime inside it, so the machine that
installs it needs no Node of its own. *Building* it is the part that needs
more: the Rust toolchain and the Tauri CLI (`cargo install tauri-cli --version
"^2"`). The whole procedure — sidecars, signing, what each platform ships —
is [`docs/INSTALL.md`](./docs/INSTALL.md).

### Where the state lives

`~/.aipass/` — settings, sessions, plugins, uploads, logs, the token. Nothing
outside your project is touched, and the token is the only secret: the key of
an added API provider lives in `~/.aipass/credentials.json` (owner-only) or in
the environment, never in `settings.json`.

### Uninstalling

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/bin/aipass      # or: npm rm -g aipass, if you used npm link (macOS/Linux)
rm -rf ~/.aipass               # only if you want the sessions and settings gone too
```

```powershell
npm rm -g aipass                # if you used npm link (Windows)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.aipass"   # optional — sessions and settings too
```

Remove the extension from `chrome://extensions`, and the app from your
desktop.

## Quick start

With the machine set up — see [Installing](#installing) — the window is one
command:

```bash
npm run desktop     # the desktop window (starts the bridge itself if needed)
```

It starts the bridge if it is not already up, starts the backend on
`127.0.0.1:8790`, and opens the window. See *The desktop window*.

An editor person? [`ide-extension/`](./ide-extension/README.md) installs a
**VS Code panel** that drives the same agent from the editor — send a task,
watch the run, approve the staged changes, without leaving the window.

One tip for long runs: Chrome **Settings → Performance → Always keep these
sites active → add `de.aipass.net`**, so a run is never frozen mid-stream.

## The desktop window

`npm run desktop` starts a small local backend on
`127.0.0.1:8790` and opens the window. `desktop/ui/` is plain HTML/CSS/JS —
no build step, open it in a browser to poke at a change. To produce the native
app instead: `npm run tauri:dev` / `npm run tauri:build` (see
[`desktop/README.md`](./desktop/README.md)).

What it holds:

- **Sessions** — resume, rename, fork; transcripts replay from disk, per
  project.
- **Diffs per file** — the agent stages edits in an overlay; you see real diffs
  and write only the files you tick.
- **Plan cards** and permission modes — `ask` / `auto` / `yolo`, with plan mode
  on top (`Shift+Tab` cycles ask → auto → plan).
- **The effort chip** — the thinking level (`off` … `max`) sits in the composer
  next to the model select, because how hard a model thinks is a per-message
  decision, not a buried setting.
- **Files and attachments** — walk the project tree, attach files, paste or
  drop images.
- **Plugins** — one `.mjs` per plugin in `~/.aipass/plugins`; a working
  scratchpad example ships in
  [`desktop/plugins-example/notes.mjs`](./desktop/plugins-example/notes.mjs).
- **Thai-first, dark/light**, with credit and context meters in the header.

Settings live in `~/.aipass/settings.json`; the gear in the header edits them as
a form, and `settings.get` / `settings.set` do the same thing from a script.

The window is where the harness becomes usable: every capability below is
reachable from it, and the window is what the harness was built to serve.

## The harness

The harness is the agent core — the part that turns a model into an agent that
can work in your project. The window drives it; the scheduler's one-shot run
(`agent.mjs`) is the same engine.

A run in the window — or a scheduled one — turns the model into a file
agent working in the current project. The model asks, the harness acts:

| Request | What happens |
|---|---|
| `NEED dir <path>` · `NEED file <path> [start-end]` | list a directory / read a file, a screen at a time |
| `SEARCH <text>` | grep-style search, `.gitignore` aware, big files skipped |
| `GLOB <pattern>` | find files by pattern |
| `SYMBOLS <file>` · `DEF <name>` · `REFS <name>` | code navigation: list a file's declarations, find a definition, find references (zero-dependency regex index) |
| `GIT <subcommand>` | read-only git inspection |
| `FETCH <url>` | read a URL — private and internal hosts refused |
| `WEB <query>` | live web search with citations |
| `CREATE` · `EDIT` · `DELETE` · `MOVE` | staged file changes — only applied per your approval |
| `RUN … END` | a shell command — only when shell is allowed |
| `ATTACH <file>` | send a file along with the message |
| `SUBAGENT ... END` | hand a self-contained piece to a helper (`role: verifier/reviewer/summariser`); add `background: true` to run it beside you, then poll with `JOBS` |
| `MCP__<server>__<tool>` | a tool from a configured MCP server (stdio) — see `~/.aipass/mcp.json` |

What the harness itself owns:

- **The run loop** — with guards for repeats, errors, stagnation and unfinished
  work, and budgets on steps, tool calls and wall-clock.
- **The file tools and the overlay** — every edit is staged in memory first;
  nothing lands on disk without an explicit apply.
- **Sessions on disk** — JSONL, one file per session, replayable, resumable,
  forkable; headers are honest about what they hold.
- **Compaction** — a per-model context budget you can see, summarise-and-rotate
  when it fills, and a tier of facts carried across rotations.
- **Permissions** — `ask` / `auto` / `yolo`, path rules that can veto reads and
  writes by glob (the **กฎไฟล์** page in the window), and a secret floor that
  holds in every mode.
- **Providers** — AiPASS through the local bridge, or any other API provider
  (`~/.aipass/providers.json`; keys in `~/.aipass/credentials.json`, owner-only,
  or in the environment).
- **The WAF** — risky spellings are shortened on the way out and restored on
  the way in, so an upstream block doesn't silently kill a run.

Guardrails that keep long tasks honest: nothing lands on disk before you
approve it, `RUN` needs the permission mode and `allowRun`, and every run
carries caps on steps, tool calls and wall-clock.

Extra capabilities available to the agent: **code navigation**
(`SYMBOLS`/`DEF`/`REFS` over a zero-dependency regex index), **MCP tools**
(`MCP__<server>__<tool>` from servers in `~/.aipass/mcp.json`), **background
helpers** (`SUBAGENT` with `background: true`, polled via `JOBS`), **cross-session
memory** (facts persisted per project, loaded into the next session's first
turn), and **test-time scaling** (run a task N times, keep the best —
`scale.mjs`). Each has an
off-switch or is opt-in; see `docs/MATURITY.md`.

The design of record is [`docs/HARNESS_DESIGN.md`](./docs/HARNESS_DESIGN.md)
(the system end to end) and [`docs/LOOP_DESIGN.md`](./docs/LOOP_DESIGN.md) (the
loop itself: stage map, guards, stop reasons, the event stream).

## The bridge

This layer is upstream — **[niawjunior/aipass-bridge](https://github.com/niawjunior/aipass-bridge)**
— and this repository continues it. The harness talks to it through one
contract; the window sits on the same contract.

The bridge is OpenAI-compatible, so anything that speaks the API can use your
AIPASS account through your browser session:

- `POST /v1/chat/completions` — streaming and not
- `GET /v1/models` — what the account can talk to

It binds `127.0.0.1:8787` by default. Every route except the health probes
(`/status`, `/health`) requires the loopback token minted once at
`~/.aipass/.token` — the bridge prints the path at boot, and the extension
popup (**Advanced**) takes the token once. The CLI and the desktop backend
read the file themselves. `AIPASS_TOKEN` sets an explicit value;
`AIPASS_REQUIRE_AUTH=0` goes back to tokenless, loopback-only operation.

### The terminal

`aipass` opens the chat TUI. Streaming markdown, reasoning folds, prompt
queueing while a run is going, `Esc` to stop, attachments, and a slash palette
that opens the moment you type `/`.

| Slash command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/model`, `/models` | switch model / list what the account can talk to |
| `/thinking` | reasoning level: `off` · `low` · `medium` · `high` · `max` |
| `/temperature` | sampling temperature `0..2`, or `default` |
| `/conversations`, `/new` | switch conversation / start a fresh one |
| `/tone`, `/format` | response tone / response format |
| `/styles`, `/image-style`, `/video-style` | generation style presets |
| `/credits` | credit quota of the account |
| `/doctor` | diagnostics for the bridge, the extension and the models |
| `/assistant` | select a custom assistant |
| `/agent`, `/agent-root` | hand the turn to the file agent / set its root |
| `/file`, `/image`, `/clip` | attach media to the next message |
| `/clear`, `/help` | clear the screen / palette help |

The harness's own stores answer from a terminal too, for scripts:
`node aipass-bridge/goal.mjs` (the durable goal), `node aipass-bridge/sessions.mjs`
(archive and restore), `node aipass-bridge/providers.mjs` (the provider
registry). The full list lives in
[`aipass-bridge/README.md`](./aipass-bridge/README.md).

## Configuration

The single source of truth is [`docs/CONFIG.md`](./docs/CONFIG.md) (held equal to the code by a
test) plus `aipass-bridge/.env.example`. The table below is the usual subset for quick reference —
if it disagrees with `CONFIG.md`, `CONFIG.md` wins:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AIPASS_PORT` / `AIPASS_HOST` | `8787` / `127.0.0.1` | where the bridge listens |
| `AIPASS_MODEL` | `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` | model when a request names none |
| `AIPASS_MODEL_FILTER` | `all` | `chat` narrows the model list to text-drivable models |
| `AIPASS_CONVERSATION_ID` | — | pin one conversation instead of "most recent" |
| `AIPASS_ASSISTANT_ID` | — | bind new conversations to a custom assistant |
| `AIPASS_TOOL_VISIBILITY` | `reasoning` | `reasoning` · `text` · `off` |
| `AIPASS_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `180000` | when a quiet run counts as idle |
| `AIPASS_BRIDGE_IDLE_MS` | `600000` | the bridge exits itself when nothing uses it; `0` never exits |
| `AIPASS_MEDIA_TIMEOUT_MS` | `900000` | how long a generation may take |
| `AIPASS_TOKEN` / `AIPASS_REQUIRE_AUTH` | `~/.aipass/.token` / on | loopback bearer token (see *The bridge and the CLI*) |
| `AIPASS_CORS_ORIGIN` | — | allow one browser origin (off by default) |

The window and the CLI keep their state in `~/.aipass/` (settings, sessions,
plugins, uploads, logs).

## Community and contributing

The fastest way to help is to try one real task and tell us what happened:

1. **Ask a question or share a workflow** in [Discussions](https://github.com/kasemjeff/aipass-desktop/discussions).
2. **Report a reproducible problem or propose an improvement** through the [issue forms](https://github.com/kasemjeff/aipass-desktop/issues/new/choose).
3. **Test a platform build** and note your OS, Node version and result in [Platform Checklist](./docs/PLATFORM_CHECKLIST.md).
4. **Send a small pull request** after reading [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md); documentation, tests and translations are welcome.

Please include the task you tried, the expected result and the actual result. Never
post tokens, private project paths or customer data. If the project saves you time,
a star or a short note about what you built helps other people decide whether to try it.

| [`docs/EVENTS.md`](./docs/EVENTS.md) | every event the harness emits, who fires it and who reads it — held equal to the code by a test |

The behavior-level change history is [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md); it is
what release notes are cut from.

Component-level docs sit next to their code:

aipass-desktop/
├─ desktop/                 the window — ours
│  ├─ main.mjs              bridge (if needed) + backend on :8790 + window
│  ├─ ui/                   plain HTML/CSS/JS — no build step
│  ├─ src-tauri/            native shell: tray, sidecar node, bundles
│  └─ plugins-example/      a plugin worth copying
├─ aipass-bridge/           the upstream layer, continued
│  ├─ harness/              the agent core — ours
│  │                        loop · tools · overlay · protocol · waf
│  │                        sessions · compaction · permissions · providers
│  ├─ bridge/               local HTTP + SSE server (upstream)
│  ├─ extension/            Chrome MV3 worker + content script + keepalive
│  └─ agent.mjs             the one-shot runner the schedule spawns
├─ docs/                    design and operations docs — see Documentation above
├─ evals/                   task fixtures — smoke set, holdout, Thai/English pairs
├─ experiments/             the experiment queue: what was tried, what it cost
├─ ide-extension/           the VS Code panel — one more surface on the same backend
├─ scripts/                 test runner, QA loop, verify, evals, the build lanes
├─ public/                  static pages and README screenshots (public/screenshots/)
└─ package.json             npm run shortcuts — nothing to install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run setup   # first-run machine setup: Node, PATH, token, bridge, browser pages
npm test        # the whole suite (bridge, extension, harness, window logic)
npm run check   # agents:lint + the suite + qa + the coverage gates — the pre-push set
npm run qa      # static checks + suite + fake-DOM window + live status
npm run verify  # suite + a sandboxed live smoke of the bridge and backend
npm run evals   # score agent runs against task checks
```

The tests are plain `node --test` — no framework, no dependencies.
