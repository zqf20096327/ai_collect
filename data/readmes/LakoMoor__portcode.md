<h1 align="center">PortCode</h1>
<p align="center"><b>Port a program to Rust and check it behaves the same.</b><br>
An open-source terminal agent that studies a program, rewrites it in Rust and compares the result with the original. It works with models you run yourself:
Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM.</p>

<sub>The terminal UI running the `port` agent on the bundled example. The model is a **scripted replay** (`portcode-mock-llm`) so the run can be reproduced; the UI and the tools (pin, survey, bash, parity, ledger) are real, and the picture is the real UI rendered without a terminal. Regenerate with `scripts/make_screenshots.sh`.</sub>

## What it does
1. **Studies** the original: pins the exact build (sha256), looks through the files, and records facts in an append-only **evidence ledger** as `observation`, `inference` or `unknown`.
2. **Ports** one slice at a time, checking each against **golden output captured from the original**.
3. **Checks** the result: `parity` (numeric tolerance, PNG diff), differential fuzzing, a terminal **screenshot per feature**, and a generated **GitHub Pages site** (plan, evidence, screenshots).

Start with `/create`: it asks what to recreate (a website, a program, a game, a file format, or nothing yet), how closely PortCode may look at it, what to build with and what you want, then starts the right agent in the right mode.

![/create](docs/screenshots/tui-create.svg)

It is a Rust rewrite of the OpenCode architecture (agents, tools, permissions, sessions, skills, MCP) combined with the [rustport](skills/rustport) skill. See [docs/OPENCODE_MAPPING.md](docs/OPENCODE_MAPPING.md) for exactly what is and isn't covered.

## First run

1. Install (below), then run `portcode` in your project folder.
2. Local model: `/provider ollama qwen3:14b`. Hosted API: `/key` and paste the key (hidden, saved with mode 600).
   Have a Claude or ChatGPT plan? `portcode -m claude-code/sonnet` or `portcode -m codex/default` runs on it through the official CLI, no key ([docs/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md](docs/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md)). `portcode mcp --print-config` shows how to give Claude Code and Codex PortCode's tools.
3. `portcode doctor` checks the setup, `/create` starts a guided port. Full steps: [docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md). The whole manual, with search, is the **[wiki](https://lakomoor.github.io/portcode/wiki/)**. `portcode update` checks for a new release.

## Install
```sh
# macOS / Linux (also WSL) — verifies the sha256 of the download
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LakoMoor/portcode/main/install.sh | sh
#   options: --with-engines core  PORTCODE_VERSION=v0.1.0  PORTCODE_INSTALL_DIR=~/bin  PORTCODE_FROM_SOURCE=1  --with-skill ~/.claude/skills  --uninstall

# Windows (PowerShell) — verifies the sha256, no Rust needed, adds portcode to your PATH
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LakoMoor/portcode/main/install.ps1 | iex

# Homebrew (after the tap is published)
brew tap LakoMoor/tap && brew install portcode

# from source (Rust >= 1.85)
cargo install --git https://github.com/LakoMoor/portcode portcode-cli
```
Then:
```sh
portcode init                 # writes portcode.json
ollama serve                  # local models need no key; hosted ones: portcode auth set <provider>
portcode doctor               # providers, toolchain, optional engines
portcode                      # full-screen UI;  portcode chat --plain for a line-based chat
portcode completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_portcode
```
Prebuilt binaries: Linux, macOS and Windows (x86_64, aarch64). The Windows build is self-contained: no Rust, no Visual C++ runtime. The `bash` tool uses `sh` from Git for Windows when it is installed, otherwise `cmd.exe`.

## Finishing 1:1
The `port` agent cannot stop early. When it tries to, PortCode checks three things: every behaviour of the original is a todo item, every todo is completed, and the last `parity` run passed on the final code (an edit after parity re-opens it). If not, the agent is sent back with the open items, and it gets extra steps when the budget runs out unfinished. The only way out is `blocked`, for a decision only you can make. Parity still compares against goldens captured from the original, so "done" means "proven", not "claimed".

## Remote control
`portcode serve` (or `/remote` in the UI) lets you drive the session from a browser or phone at [lakomoor.github.io/portcode/remote](https://lakomoor.github.io/portcode/remote/): watch, send prompts, answer permission asks, interrupt, switch agent or mode. GitHub Pages only hosts the static page; the browser connects **directly** to your machine through a tunnel you choose (Tailscale, cloudflared, SSH), authenticated with a key you create (`portcode remote new`). The secret never travels: the page answers a random challenge with an HMAC. No relay, nothing stored on GitHub. Details and the threat model: [docs/REMOTE.md](docs/REMOTE.md).

## Clean-room and deep mode
| | clean-room (default) | deep |
|---|---|---|
| looks at | the original from outside: run it, inputs, outputs, screenshots | also inside: disassembly, decompilation, emulation, raw bytes |
| switch | `--clean-room` | `--deep`, `/deep`, `"mode":"deep"` |

Deep mode drives real engines — **Capstone**, **Unicorn**, **Kuna** (decompiler), **ImHex**, plus Keystone, LIEF, YARA, angr, Frida, and system tools (rizin, radare2, binwalk, Detect It Easy, capa, jadx, wabt, upx). They install into an `engines/` folder next to the `portcode` binary, after asking, with sha256-verified downloads:
```sh
portcode engines install core          # capstone + unicorn + lief
portcode engines install kuna imhex
portcode --deep -a reverse             # tools: functions · disasm · emulate · decompile · hexdump · unity · dotnet · unity_assets
# in the UI: /workbench — functions, Pseudo-C, disassembly, hex and the evidence ledger side by side
```
For the strictest separation, run `reverse --deep` to write `docs/SPEC.md` and ledger entries in your own words, then `port --clean-room` to build from those only. Details: [docs/ENGINES.md](docs/ENGINES.md).

![The engines deep mode drives](docs/screenshots/deep-toolkit.png)
<sub>Every line on these cards comes from running the tools on the bundled wordstat binary. Marks belong to their projects ([sources](docs/assets/engines/SOURCES.md)). Regenerate: `scripts/make_toolkit_png.sh`.</sub>

![deep mode](docs/screenshots/tui-deep.svg)

**Desktop app** (`gui/`, experimental): the same agent in a window built on GPUI Fast: a transcript with foldable tool calls, agent / deep / allow-all chips, and a ledger sidebar with context use, evidence, the parity verdict and the checklist. Built separately from source (`cd gui && cargo run --release`, see [gui/README.md](gui/README.md)); `portcode gui` opens it. No release download yet.

![PortCode desktop app](docs/screenshots/gui.png)

**Workbench** (`/workbench`, deep only): a function list, Pseudo-C from Kuna, Capstone disassembly and a hex view, the evidence ledger on the right and the agent underneath. `j/k` move, `1 2 3` switch view, `/` filters, `a` asks the agent to explain the function and record it, `q` closes. Everything on screen is real tool output.

![workbench](docs/screenshots/tui-workbench.svg)
<sub>Deep mode on the bundled example: strings, ARM64 disassembly and a Unicorn run of the prologue (real tools; scripted model).</sub>

## Keys (full-screen UI)
`enter` send · `alt+enter` newline · `tab`/`shift+tab` switch agent · `/` commands · `esc esc` cancel the request · `/deep` · `/clean` switch mode · `ctrl+t` show reasoning · `ctrl+b` sidebar · `pgup/pgdn`/wheel scroll · `ctrl+c` interrupt / clear / quit. Permission dialog: `y` once · `a` always · `n` reject. `portcode --resume` lists this project's saved sessions to pick from (`-c` continues the latest; `portcode sessions` lists, shows and deletes them). `/yolo` approves everything without asking (a red `allow-all` chip stays on screen; `/yolo off` ends it). `/venv on|off` lets the agent create and use a Python `.venv` (on by default; config `"venv"`). `/team on` (or `"team": {"enabled": true, "parallel": 3}`) adds the `team` agent: an orchestrator that runs a project manager, tech lead, researchers, developers, a tester and a reviewer in parallel; permission asks from parallel workers queue up in the dialog.

## Use
```sh
portcode                                  # full-screen UI, agent "build"
portcode -a port                          # the rustport workflow
portcode run -a reverse -y "Explain how ./app stores its save files" --json
portcode models -p ollama                 # list served models
portcode eval -m ollama/qwen3:14b        # probe: chat, tool-call JSON, read→edit round trip
portcode port scaffold mygame             # workspace + docs/PORT.md
portcode port pin original/game.exe --version 1.0.3
portcode port shot feature-x -s ui.menu -- ./target/release/mygame --help
portcode port parity tests/golden tests/out
portcode port site --title "mygame port"  # docs/site → GitHub Pages
portcode skill export ~/.claude/skills    # use the rustport skill in other agents
```
Everything the model can do is a tool you can also run by hand: `portcode tool <name> '{json}'`.

## Models
Any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with tool calling. Open-weight quirks are absorbed by the client (reasoning streams, inline `<think>`, text-form tool calls, broken JSON, quoted numbers, rejected optional fields, stalled streams). Profiles exist for the DeepSeek and Qwen families (including small/"flash" variants) and are overridable per model; prompts are short, rule-first and prefix-cache friendly. Details: [docs/PROVIDERS.md](docs/PROVIDERS.md).

> **Status:** tested end-to-end against a scripted server and the bundled example. Not yet benchmarked on specific DeepSeek/Qwen releases — run `portcode eval` on yours and tune the profile. Alpha software.

## Safety
Edits and commands ask first (allow / always / deny; patterns in `portcode.json`). `sudo`, `curl | sh`, `rm -rf /` are always refused. File tools stay inside the project (symlink-aware) and protect `.git`, `.env`, keys. Shell runs non-interactively: closed stdin, deadline, capped output, process-group kill. Keys never go in `portcode.json`. Only study software you own or are authorised to examine: [clean-room guide](skills/rustport/references/clean-room.md).
