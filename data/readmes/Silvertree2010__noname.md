## About

noname is a terminal UI (TUI) for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), built in Rust with ratatui. It replaces the interface of Claude Code, not the engine. `claude` runs underneath, so your subscription, plugins, skills, MCP servers and hooks keep working. Made for kitty with a transparent background, works in any truecolor terminal and in Windows Terminal.

- streaming text, thinking and tools, diffs that write themselves in
- inline permissions and questions, rewind with `esc esc`, `/btw` side questions
- live context and limit bars, cost under every answer
- themes (default, dracula, tokyo-night, catppuccin mocha, or your own), animated backgrounds, self updates
- image paste, `@` file mentions, background shells and subagents, `/diff`, `/mcp`, `/resume`
- Linux, macOS and Windows; optional Codex engine with `--codex`

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Silvertree2010/noname/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```
```powershell
irm https://github.com/Silvertree2010/noname/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

Also: Homebrew (`brew tap Silvertree2010/noname && brew trust Silvertree2010/noname && brew install noname`), [Scoop](https://github.com/Silvertree2010/scoop-noname), `.deb` and `.rpm` from the [releases](https://github.com/Silvertree2010/noname/releases/latest), or `cargo install --git https://github.com/Silvertree2010/noname`. AUR is coming. Needs a logged-in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).

## Usage

```sh
noname              # new session
noname -c           # continue the latest session
noname -r <id>      # resume a session
noname --codex      # use Codex as the engine
```

Other flags go straight to `claude`.

| key | | command | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enter` | send | `/noname` | settings |
| `shift+enter` | new line | `/theme` | color theme |
| `esc` | stop | `/background` | animated background |
| `esc esc` | rewind | `/default-permission` | starting mode |
| `shift+tab` | cycle mode | `/resume` | older sessions |
| `ctrl+o` | details | `/btw` | side question |
| `→` | accept suggestion | `/model` | cycle models |
| `ctrl+v` | paste image | | |
| `ctrl+backspace` | delete word | `/tasks` | background tasks |
| `ctrl+g` | edit in $EDITOR | `/mcp` | mcp servers |
| `ctrl+b` | move to background | `/diff` | workspace diff |
| `@` | mention a file | `/effort` | effort level |
| `↓` | tasks | `/rename` | name the session |
| `drag` | select and copy | `double / triple click` | copy word / line |
| `ctrl+z` / `ctrl+y` | undo / redo input | `/copy` | copy last answer |
| `ctrl+f` | find in chat | `/copy code` | copy last code block |
| `alt+↑` / `alt+↓` | jump between prompts | | |
| `ctrl+o` on a paste | unfold pasted text | | |

Every Claude Code command and skill works as usual.

### Custom themes

Drop a `<name>.theme` file into `~/.config/noname/themes/` (`%APPDATA%\noname\themes\` on Windows) and it shows up in `/theme`. Missing keys fall back to the default theme, and a file named like a built-in theme replaces it.

```ini
desc    = black, steel, red
fg      = #ececec
bright  = #ffffff
muted   = #b4b4b4
faint   = #7a7a7a
accent  = #e0362b
accent2 = #c9ccd1
soft    = #d6d9de
cyan    = #9aa7b4
green   = #a9c4b0
red     = #ff6b5e
pink    = #d08a8a
base    = #0a0a0a
```

## License

[AGPL-3.0](LICENSE). noname bundles nothing; Claude Code, Codex and the background programs run from your own installation.
