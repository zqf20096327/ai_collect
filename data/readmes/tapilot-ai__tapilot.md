# Tapilot

**Give your Android phone a task in plain language.**

**English** · [简体中文](README.zh.md)

Ask Tapilot to open an app, find information on screen or work through a task
across apps. You can add instructions while it runs, stop it, and review the
screenshots and actions afterward.

For a first try: “Open Calculator and calculate 12 × 8.” Check the result on the
phone, then open the execution report to see how Tapilot got there.

Tapilot operates your phone’s visible screen, so let it finish or stop the task
before using other apps. Setup requires a supported vision-model connection and
Android accessibility permission. Everyday use needs **no ADB, Shizuku or root**.
This project is experimental; always check important results.

## What you can do

- **Operate apps in natural language.** Tap, swipe, scroll, type, launch apps and
  move between them using Midscene's screenshot-based understanding.
- **Follow a task across apps.** Keep plans and operation results, add a requirement
  while running, or explicitly stop and retry. Interrupted tasks do not replay
  automatically after an app restart.
- **Check results on screen.** Each phone operation ends with a separate screenshot
  check against the current requirements. Missing evidence remains unknown, and
  verified progress is retained for later steps.
- **Inspect what happened.** Open the Midscene HTML replay with screenshots,
  model plans, actions and errors; export it when needed.
- **Talk to the phone.** Optional Volcengine / Deepgram transcription and speech
  playback, with separate provider credentials and an automatic-read setting.
- **Control it over Wi-Fi.** The local [Tapilot plugin](plugins/tapilot/README.md)
  connects a paired computer to the phone over pinned TLS. Wireless use requires
  an unlocked phone and exclusive control, without ADB or USB.

### Take over a task

Select **Take over** while a task runs. Wait for the stopped confirmation before
using the phone; an action already dispatched may still finish while stopping.
The handoff card offers **Return to app** and **Continue task**. Continuing keeps
the saved task context and asks the agent to inspect the current screen before
acting. It does not resend the original task as a fresh request. A saved composer
draft is retained. A task waiting for your answer also offers these controls.
Leaving the chat after a confirmed handoff does not restart the task.
Tasks stopped by opening the floating conversation panel also show the handoff card.

## Try it

Requires an **arm64 Android 11+** phone and a supported vision model. There is no
verified public release pipeline yet; build a development APK using the steps below.

1. Install the APK, open Tapilot and enable **Tapilot device control** in Android
   Accessibility settings.
2. In Tapilot settings, configure an HTTP or HTTPS vision-model API, or choose the existing
   ChatGPT (SIWC) connection option where available. Fill credentials on the phone.
3. Start with a simple visible task, such as opening Calculator and computing 12 × 8. Inspect
   the actual screen and execution record before relying on the reply.

The composer offers automatic execution (YOLO), confirmation for critical
operations, or confirmation for every phone operation. **New installations default
to YOLO.** Choose the confirmation mode appropriate to your task before sending it.

The first-task guide shows whether a model is configured and device control is
connected. It can fill a Calculator example into an empty composer; you review
and send it yourself. Existing drafts and attachments are retained. Configuration
is not a successful connection test: the task exercises the model, screenshots
and actions. The guide stays available after a failure, and is dismissed after a
verified phone task succeeds or when you choose Skip guide.

For a self-hosted model on your LAN, use its OpenAI-compatible base URL, such as
`http://192.168.1.100:8000/v1`, and a supported vision model. The address must be
reachable from the phone; `localhost` refers to the phone itself. The app still
requires an API key; if your server does not require authentication, enter a
non-empty placeholder such as `local`. HTTP sends API keys, messages and screenshots
without encryption. Use it only on a trusted network; prefer HTTPS otherwise.

### Set up voice input (optional)

In **Settings → Voice input**, choose a provider. The app includes links to its
console and official setup guide:

- **Volcengine:** sign in and complete identity verification, enable Streaming
  Speech Recognition 2.0 in Doubao Voice, then create a key in
  [API Key management](https://console.volcengine.com/speech/new/setting/apikeys).
  Use a Doubao Voice API Key, not an Ark model key or legacy APP ID.
  [Official guide](https://docs.volcengine.com/docs/DoubaoVoice/QuickStartNewConsole?lang=en).
- **Deepgram:** sign in to the [console](https://console.deepgram.com/), select a
  project, then open **Settings → API Keys → Create a New API Key** and grant
  transcription access. Copy the secret when created; it is only shown once.
  [Official guide](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/create-additional-api-keys).

Paste the key into the app and select **Check connection** to save and verify it.

## How the visual loop works

![Visual action and verification loop](artwork/visual-loop.en.svg)

Midscene supplies the visual planning, locating, action execution and reports.
Tapilot supplies the native Android UI, device adapter, model transport, saved
conversations and task lifecycle. The embedded Node.js worker runs on the phone;
model inference uses the configured remote provider. **On-device orchestration
does not mean offline inference.**

Accessibility is the device execution layer, not the visual locator. Native text
editing can use the focused editable accessibility node, and app launch uses
Android's launcher catalogue. Custom-rendered inputs and protected screens can
therefore remain unsupported even when their pixels are visible.

## Build and develop

Use Node.js 24, pnpm 12.4.1, JDK 17, Android SDK Platform 35 and Build Tools 35.0.0.
Set `JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME`. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the
complete host prerequisites and signing setup.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
npm ci --prefix plugins/tapilot
node plugins/tapilot/scripts/patch-midscene-zod.mjs plugins/tapilot
npm ci --prefix tests/midscene
node plugins/tapilot/scripts/patch-midscene-zod.mjs tests/midscene
pnpm build:android
pnpm check:quick
```

The local APK is `app/build/outputs/apk/beta/app-beta.apk`. It uses this machine's
development signing certificate, which cannot update a differently signed app.
Production signing is configured separately. ADB may be used by developers to
install and test; it is not required for Tapilot's runtime automation.

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `app/` | Native Android UI, credentials, device actions and lifecycle |
| `node-runtime/` | Embedded Pi agent, Midscene runner and deployment dependencies |
| `packages/android-accessibility/` | Midscene adapter for Android AccessibilityService |
| `plugins/tapilot/` | Computer-side Wi-Fi control plugin |
| `tests/midscene/` | 23 E2E cases and opt-in device fault fixtures |

Run `pnpm check` for the full local test/build gate and `pnpm check:security` for
dependency audits. Device-backed E2E is separate; 23 authored cases do not imply
23 verified passes. See the [E2E guide and evidence](tests/midscene/README.md) and
[contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If the execution process exits before producing a report, Tapilot shows its exit
code and available failure diagnostic. An expired preloaded process is restarted
only before any test or device RPC has begun; a running phone task is not replayed.

Historical device runs do not establish a pass for the latest source.

## Limits and data

- A model can misread a screen, infer an unobserved fact or give an incorrect
  completion answer. The E2E ledger distinguishes repaired cases, remaining
  failures and untested builds. Verify important outcomes from the actual screen.
- Locked or protected screens, OEM background restrictions and inaccessible
  custom text inputs can stop execution. Only arm64 devices are bundled today.
- Screenshots and task content are sent to your selected model provider. Optional
  ASR/TTS sends audio or reply text to the selected speech provider. Account tokens
  and API keys stay in Android Keystore-backed storage; this does not make model
  requests local or prevent provider-side processing.
- Reports contain screenshots, prompts and model output. Review them before
  sharing. The phone automatically prunes older reports to keep at most 20 files
  and 200 MB, always retaining the newest report even if it exceeds that size.
  Export reports you need to keep before running many more operations. Exported
  reports and computer-plugin data have their own lifetimes.

[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for transport, credential storage and vulnerability reporting.

## Built on

**[Midscene](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene)** is the foundation of the
visual automation, Android adapter integration, Test Runner and execution reports.

Thanks also to [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) for the conversation/tool
loop, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages)
for the Android runtime, [Android Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose)
for the native UI, and the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)
for the computer plugin. See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for more upstream projects,
license identifiers and redistribution work still required before release.

## Optional background-display experiment

Debug builds offer **Settings → Developer experiments → Background screen (Experimental)**.
It requires [explicit shell-helper authorization and connection](docs/experiments/shell-assisted-display.md),
offers guided notification pairing, automatic local connection and optional restart recovery without a computer,
is off by default, and checks isolated rendering, captured frames, targeted
gestures and test-app launches. A separate opt-in Agent trial can increment and verify the built-in test counter using the configured model; arbitrary background tasks are not supported.
See the [experiment protocol and limits](docs/experiments/background-display.md).
Beta and Release builds do not include the probe.

## Floating virtual-screen preview (Experimental)

**Experimental · Debug only · off by default.** The probe offers a movable
preview over other apps. The bounded Agent trial supports pause, manual takeover and explicit continuation with a fresh screenshot; normal conversation tasks still use the primary screen.
Tap and swipe requests target only the virtual display; Android may reject them.
See [setup, permissions and limitations](docs/experiments/floating-virtual-display.md).
