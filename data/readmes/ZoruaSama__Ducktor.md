# Ducktor

Ducktor: Use AI to generate code explanations and make reading easier with a VS Code extension.

Ducktor = Duck + Doctor

HomePage: https://zoruasama.github.io/Ducktor/

## Overview

Ducktor stores code explanations in separate `.ducktor` files and displays them alongside source code in VS Code. It supports project onboarding, implementation walkthroughs, and code review without changing source code just to add explanations.

This repository contains two complementary components that can also be used independently:

| Component | Purpose | Entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ducktor Generator skill | Guides an AI agent to read source code and generate or update `.ducktor` files at a requested scope and depth | [SKILL.md](skills/ducktor-generator/SKILL.md) |
| Ducktor VS Code extension | Reads `.ducktor` files and displays block explanations, terms, and line-by-line previews | [Extension directory](vsc-plugin/) |

Workflow: **source code → AI + generator skill → `.ducktor` files → VS Code extension → reading and navigation**.

The extension is not an AI generator and does not require model or API-key configuration. Generation is handled by the AI host using the skill. You can also write `.ducktor` files manually and use only the extension.

## Features

- **Layered generation**: L1–L5 presets with independently configurable capabilities. Scope and depth are separate choices.
- **Block explanations**: Read an overview through an end-of-line hint on a block's first line, or in a right-hand panel.
- **Term definitions**: Dotted-underlined keywords reveal definitions on hover, with aliases and global, module, or local scopes.
- **Line-by-line reading**: A standalone tab aligns complete read-only source code on the left with Markdown explanations on the right, with an overall-explanation view available.
- **Connected references**: Navigate to source files, line ranges, workspace symbols, and external documentation.
- **Anchor-based positioning**: Function, class, text, and other anchors help relocate blocks, with line ranges as a fallback.
- **Bilingual interface**: English and Simplified Chinese notifications, diagnostics, and explanation panels. Explanation text follows the language requested during generation.

## Quick start

### Ask your Agent to install the skill and extension

Copy this prompt into your Agent:

```text
Please install the Ducktor skill and VSIX extension from https://github.com/ZoruaSama/Ducktor.
1. Detect the OS and installed VS Code-like IDEs (VS Code, Cursor, Qoder, Trae, CodeBuddy, and others). List names, versions, and available CLI or installation paths.
2. Ask which IDE(s) should receive the extension and which Agent(s) I use. Wait for my confirmation before installing.
3. Install the complete skill globally under my home directory, never in the project. Include SKILL.md and references/. Native paths: ~/.codex/skills/ducktor-generator/ for Codex, ~/.claude/skills/ducktor-generator/ for Claude Code, ~/.cursor/skills/ducktor-generator/ for Cursor.
4. For OpenSkills, check Node.js/npm, install npm install -g openskills if needed, then run openskills install ZoruaSama/Ducktor --global --universal and select ducktor-generator. Confirm the Agent can load ~/.agent/skills/; otherwise use its native global path. Update later with openskills update ducktor-generator.
5. Download the latest released VSIX from GitHub Releases. Use the selected IDE's supported installation method to install it into the current user's global extension directory, not the project or another IDE. Preserve existing settings. Ask before adding dependencies, elevating privileges, or overwriting files.
6. Verify the extension and complete skill are installed. Report actual paths and required IDE/Agent reloads. Never report unexecuted steps as successful.
7. End by showing the user these usage instructions:
Press Ctrl + Shift + P (macOS: ⌘ + Shift + P) to open the command palette. Search directly for these keywords, select the corresponding toggle commands, and make sure each feature is enabled:
hover: enable hover tooltips.
codelens: enable CodeLens.
inlay hints: enable inline hints.
```

### 1. Install the VS Code extension

Requires **VS Code 1.85.0 or later**.

Download the VSIX file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ZoruaSama/Ducktor/releases), then run `Extensions: Install from VSIX...` in the VS Code command palette and select the downloaded file.

After installation, open the project folder you want to explore in VS Code, rather than opening only a standalone source file.

Ducktor is not yet published to the extension marketplace; use GitHub Releases. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (`⌘ + Shift + P` on macOS) to open the command palette. Search directly for `hover`, `codelens`, and `inlay hints` (or `inline hints`), select the corresponding toggle commands, and make sure Hover, CodeLens, and Inlay Hints are enabled. Alternatively, run `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)` and merge these entries into existing settings:

```json
{
  "editor.inlayHints.enabled": "on",
  "editor.hover.enabled": true,
  "editor.codeLens": true
}
```

### 2. Load the generator skill

#### Install with OpenSkills

Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm), then install [OpenSkills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills) and the complete skill globally:

```sh
npm install -g openskills
openskills install ZoruaSama/Ducktor --global --universal
```

Select `ducktor-generator` when prompted. `--global --universal` installs into `~/.agent/skills/`; `--universal` alone is still project-level. Confirm your Agent can load the universal directory; otherwise use its native global skill directory above.

Update the installed skill from its original source:

```sh
openskills update ducktor-generator
openskills list
```

For Agents that read `AGENTS.md`, run `openskills sync` in the relevant project to register the globally installed skill. This updates project registration, not the skill's installation location. Other Agents follow their own loading conventions.

#### Manual installation

[skills/ducktor-generator](skills/ducktor-generator/) contains `SKILL.md` and its on-demand `references/`.

Copy the **entire skill directory**, including `SKILL.md` and `references/`, into your Agent's global skill directory under your home directory (`~`), not the project:

- Codex: `~/.codex/skills/ducktor-generator/`
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/ducktor-generator/`
- Cursor: `~/.cursor/skills/ducktor-generator/`

Restart or reload the Agent as required. If it does not discover the skill, ask it to read `skills/ducktor-generator/SKILL.md` in your cloned repository and follow its procedure. The repository's `skills/` directory is a distribution location, not an automatically discovered installation path.

Example requests:

```text
Generate L3 Ducktor explanations for src/main.js in English, with verified references to related symbols.

Generate L5 explanations for the current function. Explain only the type members it uses, not the entire class.

Generate L4 + G explanations for functions affected by this change, focusing on line-by-line behavior and review concerns.
```

The skill reads current source code, verifies positions and references, and recursively creates the workspace-root `.ducktor` directory and required mirrored subdirectories when missing. Updates preserve valid content outside the requested scope.

### 3. Read explanations in source code

- In the default `hover` mode, hover over the Ducktor end-of-line hint on a block's first line or a dotted-underlined term.
- In `panel` mode, use end-of-line hints or term-hover links to read in the right-hand panel; explanation bodies are not shown in hovers.
- When a file has valid `lines` entries, use its top-of-file line-by-line CodeLens to open the standalone two-column preview.
- Click line numbers in the preview to return to and locate source code. Switch directly between overall and line-by-line explanations.

**Enable both Inlay Hints and Hover in VS Code** to see Ducktor's end-of-line hints and hover explanations or navigation links. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (`⌘ + Shift + P` on macOS), search directly for `hover`, `codelens`, and `inlay hints` (or `inline hints`), and use the corresponding toggle commands to ensure these features are enabled. Alternatively, add the following to your settings JSON:

```json
{
  "editor.inlayHints.enabled": "on",
  "editor.hover.enabled": true
}
```

End-of-line hints require **Inlay Hints**, while hover content and links require **Hover**. Term underlines do not depend on Inlay Hints. The top-of-file line-by-line entry also requires **CodeLens** (`editor.codeLens: true`). If hints or hovers are missing, check whether workspace or language-specific settings override these options. The standalone preview is independent of `ducktor.displayMode` and can coexist with the right-hand panel.

### 4. Open the Ducktor File Explorer

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS), search for **Ducktor: Open File Explorer / 打开文件目录**, and run it. The command ID is `ducktor.showIndex`.

![Ducktor File Explorer overview](doc/ducktor-explorer.png)

The standalone page lists source files with Ducktor explanations in their original directory structure. Expand a file to browse **line-by-line explanations**, **code snippets**, and **term explanations**. Click a file name or an explanation entry to navigate to the original source and corresponding lines.

Search matches **file names only**, not directory paths or explanation content. Filter line explanations and diagrams independently by **All / Present / Absent**; both filters apply together. Use **Refresh** to reload the list.

## Generation depth

| Level | Name | Default content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | Overview | A: responsibilities and results |
| L2 | Usage | A + B: important inputs, outputs, prerequisites, side effects, and failure behavior |
| L3 | Understanding | A + B + C: execution stages, branches, and data flow |
| L4 | Line-by-line | A + B + C + D: explanations for every meaningful source line |
| L5 | Guided learning | A + B + C + D + E + F: necessary symbols, relevant type members, and collaboration |

**G: review concerns** is an independent switch, such as `L4 + G`. Custom combinations such as `L1 + E` and `L3 + E` are also supported.

L5 explains only members involved in the current function by default. It does not enumerate an entire class or recursively expand dependencies. Levels and capabilities are generation policies, **not YAML fields in `.ducktor` files**. See [Capabilities and levels](skills/ducktor-generator/references/capabilities.md) for the full policy.

## File layout and minimal example

Mirror the source path relative to the workspace root and append the `.ducktor` extension:

```text
my-project/
├── src/
│   └── main.js
└── .ducktor/
    └── src/
        └── main.js.ducktor
```

The extension reads mirrored files under the workspace-root `.ducktor/` directory, **not same-named files next to source code**. Each folder in a multi-root workspace maintains its own `.ducktor/` directory.

Given these three source lines in `src/main.js`:

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

The corresponding `.ducktor/src/main.js.ducktor` can contain:

```yaml
blocks:
  - range: "1-3"
    anchor:
      type: function
      name: greet
    content: |
      Return a greeting string using `name`, without modifying external state.
      See the return expression at [main.js#2].
    lines:
      - line: 1
        content: "Define the `greet` function with a `name` parameter."
      - line: 2
        content: "Build and return the greeting using a template literal."
terms:
  - symbol: name
    type: variable
    scope: local
    block: 1
    content: |
      The name supplied by the current caller, used to construct the greeting.
```

Key rules:

- Use **UTF-8 YAML**. New files have top-level `blocks` and `terms` lists; use `[]` for an unused list.
- `range` and `lines.line` use **1-based source line numbers**. A local term's `block` is a **1-based index into the original `blocks` list**.
- `content` provides the overall explanation. Optional `lines` entries appear **only in the standalone preview**.
- File references are relative to the **source file's directory**, not the `.ducktor` file's directory. `[main.js#2]` above targets line 2 of `src/main.js`.
- Anchors help relocate a block that moves as a whole; edits inside a block still require updating line-by-line positions.
- The extension does not generate, migrate, or maintain explanation paths when source files are renamed. The skill, user, or another external tool handles those operations.

See [Ducktor format specification](rules.md) for the complete format. The generator skill provides focused, on-demand references for [core format](skills/ducktor-generator/references/format-core.md), [Markdown and links](skills/ducktor-generator/references/markdown-links.md), [line explanations](skills/ducktor-generator/references/line-explanations.md), [terms and types](skills/ducktor-generator/references/terms.md), and [validation](skills/ducktor-generator/references/validation.md). These reference documents are currently written in Chinese.

## Extension settings and common commands

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ducktor.enabled` | `true` | Enable explanation display |
| `ducktor.language` | `en` | Interface language: `en` or `zh-CN` |
| `ducktor.displayMode` | `hover` | Overall-explanation display mode: `hover` or `panel` |

Example VS Code settings JSON:

```json
{
  "ducktor.enabled": true,
  "ducktor.language": "en",
  "ducktor.displayMode": "hover"
}
```

The language setting does not translate existing explanation content. Command titles and setting descriptions remain in English.

| Command palette title | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Ducktor: Refresh Code Explanations` | Refresh explanations manually |
| `Ducktor: Show Explanation in Right-hand Panel` | Read explanations in the right-hand panel |
| `Ducktor: Open Line-by-line Preview` | Open the current file's line-by-line preview |
| `Ducktor: Clear Current Explanation File` | Delete the current source file's explanation file |
| `Ducktor: Clear All Explanation Files` | Delete workspace explanation files after confirmation |

**Clear commands delete files; they do not just hide explanations.** To temporarily disable display, set `ducktor.enabled` to `false`. The extension watches mirrored explanation files for creation, changes, and deletion. Refresh manually if the display is stale.

Install **Node.js and npm**, then run these commands in `vsc-plugin/` in order:

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
npm test
npm run package
```

`check` validates JavaScript syntax, `test` runs Node.js tests, and `package` builds a VSIX using VSCE. Packaging requires a Node.js version compatible with the development dependencies.

To debug, **open `vsc-plugin/` as the VS Code workspace** and press `F5` using the included Extension Host launch configuration. Open a test project containing `.ducktor/` in the new window.
