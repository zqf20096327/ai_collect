# SAVR

**S**can · **A**nalyze · **V**erify · **R**eplay

An automated white-box vulnerability scanning and verification pipeline: static analysis
produces candidate findings, and a local LLM returns a verdict plus a machine-usable trigger spec;
deterministic replay fires that spec at a running target, and a finding counts as confirmed
only on structured impact evidence. The LLM never touches the target; everything downstream
is deterministic, replayable and auditable.

```

- A1 runs CodeQL official suites plus custom queries for shapes the official queries do not
  model (`prepareCall`, Spring `JdbcTemplate`, weak hash algorithms), with a deterministic
  heuristic fallback so a failed CodeQL build never silently produces an empty report.
- A2 makes one LLM call per sink file and returns both a verdict and a machine-usable trigger
  spec, JSON-validated with one repair round. A file that fails is recorded as an
  `analysis_error` placeholder and counted in the stage contract; it is never dropped, because
  a dropped file is indistinguishable from a clean file in the final report.
- D1/D2 replay the specs. Confirmation requires structured impact evidence: a probe event at
  the sink, a family oracle (SQL boolean pairs, path traversal file signatures, expression
  evaluation, reflection), or an out-of-band callback. "Reached the sink" and "the model says
  it is harmful" are each insufficient on their own.
- Unconfirmed candidates keep a terminal state and a failure attribution, so a missed
  vulnerability can be told apart from a target that was down, an endpoint that 404s, or a
  payload that never arrived.
- Deterministic retries are always on. I2, an LLM feedback loop that re-judges based on
  replay diffs, is opt-in (`SAST_AI_CLOSED_LOOP=1`) and off by default.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or newer.
- Node.js 20 or newer, for the frontend.
- JDK 11 or newer and Maven, to build the IAST probe (it is built, not shipped).
- CodeQL CLI, for the static analysis stage. `uv run python scripts/fetch_tools.py --dest tools
  --only codeql` downloads the bundle into `tools/codeql/`; alternatively set `CODEQL_BIN` or put
  `codeql` on `PATH`. The bundle is about 1GB and is not vendored.
- A running HTTP target with the bundled IAST java agent attached. Target applications, JDKs,
  Tomcat and third-party binaries are not vendored; you supply your own.
- An LLM endpoint. Any OpenAI-compatible local server works; the defaults point at Ollama.

Windows is the primary development platform. Linux and macOS should work but are untested.

The control panel UI is currently Chinese-only. This README and the generated API schema are
in English.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjio3/SAVR.git && cd SAVR
uv sync --frozen --group dev
cp .env.example .env
uv run python scripts/fetch_tools.py --dest tools --only codeql
ollama pull qwen3:8b
```

Edit `.env` for your host, ports and probe token. **SAVR does not load `.env`
automatically** — pass it to uv with `--env-file .env` as shown below, or export
the same keys in your shell. Start the backend with:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python -m src.cli.service_server
```

`uv.lock` pins every dependency and `pyproject.toml` is the canonical declaration. The repository
root is the import root, so no package installation step is needed. `uv run` is the supported
entry point for every command in this document; a virtualenv on `PATH` works as well.

The backend listens on `127.0.0.1:8000`. The frontend runs separately:
`cd frontend && npm ci && npm run dev`, listening on `127.0.0.1:5173`.
On Windows, `scripts/dev_all.ps1` starts both; `scripts/dev_backend.ps1` and
`scripts/dev_frontend.ps1` start them individually.

The backend serves its own API reference: while it is running, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` is
the interactive documentation and `http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json` is the
machine-readable schema.

## First run

### Build the probe

The IAST probe is built, not shipped; its source lives in `probe-java/`. It needs JDK 11 and
Maven:

```bash
mvn -B -DskipTests -f probe-java/pom.xml clean package
jar cf probe-java/target/sec-probe-bootstrap.jar -C probe-java/target/classes com/rasp/probe/TaintHub.class
```

The first command produces `sec-probe.jar` (the probe); the second produces
`sec-probe-bootstrap.jar`, which holds only `TaintHub` and must be on `-Xbootclasspath/a` so the
probe can see that class before the JDK class loaders start. **Run both commands — Maven does
not create the bootstrap jar.** Stop the target JVM before rebuilding, or the jar is locked.

Attach it like this (the flags come from `scripts/launch/launch_java_quote.py`):

```bash
java -Xbootclasspath/a:probe-java/target/sec-probe-bootstrap.jar \
     -javaagent:probe-java/target/sec-probe.jar \
     -Dsec.server.url=http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
     -Dsec.agent.id=<agent-id> \
     -Dsec.app.name=<app-name> \
     -Dsec.agent.token=<the probe_token stored in the database> \
     -Dsec.app.packages=<your business package prefix, e.g. com.example> \
     -Dsec.network.timeout.ms=5000 \
     -jar your-target.jar
```

Four things must be right:

- `-Dsec.app.packages` takes the **real business package prefix**. A wrong value raises no error;
  you simply get zero instrumentation and zero events. This is the most common cause of "the
  scan finished and found nothing".
- `-Dsec.server.url` must use `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`. On some hosts the latter resolves to
  `::1` while the backend listens on IPv4 only.
- `-Dsec.agent.token` must equal `iast_sessions.probe_token` in the database. On a mismatch the
  ingest endpoint still answers HTTP 200 with `accepted=0`, which looks like success.
- The probe must be attached **before** the JVM starts; runtime attach is not supported.

Verify the attachment before scanning; only `ready=true` means it is wired up:

```bash
uv run python tools/probe_preflight.py --workspace-id <id> --http
```

It checks that the session row exists, the heartbeat is fresh, and an `X-Agent-Token` handshake
was accepted with a non-empty `session_id`. It writes no events and does not refresh the
heartbeat, so it cannot make a dead session look alive.

### Attach the probe to your own target

No target source is vendored here and no target is special-cased. You attach the probe to your
own application with the flags above. `scripts/launch/launch_java_quote.py` is the minimal
complete example: it starts a Spring Boot app, resolves the probe jars, reads the token from the
database and assembles the JVM arguments. Adapt it to your own start command.

`scripts/launch/launch_stack.py` starts SAVR itself (backend plus frontend watchdog), not a
target.

Two environment variables are useful: `SAST_AI_PROBE_JAR` overrides the probe jar path, and
`SAST_AI_TOOLS_DIR` points at the directory `scripts/fetch_tools.py` populated.

### Submit a scan

Create a workspace that points at your target source, either in the UI
(Workspaces → New) or with `POST /api/workspaces` carrying `name` and
`target_path`. Attach the probe as shown above, then submit a task. A dry run
prints the payload without writing anything:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python scripts/submit_scan_task.py --name my-first-scan --dry-run
```

Drop `--dry-run` to submit. If the workspace is not the default one, pass
`--workspace-id <id>`. The runner that executes a submitted task is also
available for debugging:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python -m src.cli.scan_task_runner --task-id <id> --target /path/to/target/src \
  --output-dir output/run1 --no-sca
```

`--shard-file <path>` is optional: point it at a JSON shard manifest to narrow the scan to the
entry points listed there. Omit it to scan everything; the manifest format is documented in the
loader in `src/core/scan_scope.py`.

Before pointing a run at an external target, check that the probe session and token actually
match. When they do not, the ingest endpoint answers HTTP 200 with `accepted=0`, which is easy
to misread as success:

```bash
uv run python tools/probe_preflight.py --workspace-id <id> --http
```

`ready=true` means the session row exists, the heartbeat is fresh, and a handshake carrying
`X-Agent-Token` was accepted with a non-empty `session_id` and no `errors`. The check writes no
events and does not refresh the heartbeat, so it cannot make a dead session look alive.

---

## Configuration

Configuration is environment-first. `.env.example` lists the core runtime keys with their
defaults; model hyperparameters live in `config/model_capabilities.yaml`.

To choose a model:

1. `cp config/config.example.yaml config.yaml`. The copy is gitignored because it may hold
   credentials.
2. Set `api.provider` and `api.model` to one of the sections in that file: `ollama` (default, no
   key required), `qwen`, `doubao`, `minimax`, `deepseek`, `openai-compatible`, `claude`, or
   `anthropic-compatible`.
3. Fill that section. The local `ollama` section needs `base_url` and `model`; cloud sections
   need `base_url`, `api_key` and `model`. Any value may be written as `"${ENV_VAR}"` so the
   secret stays in the environment.

Environment variables keep the `SAST_AI_` prefix from the project's earlier name. That prefix
is part of the run contract and is kept for backwards compatibility.

### Where the data lives

The SQLite database is `SAST_AI_DB_PATH` (default `data/app.db`). The schema is created on
first start and migrated in place afterwards, with applied versions recorded in the
`schema_migrations` table. Stop the backend and copy that single file to back up a scan.

### Where to start

- Change how a finding is confirmed: `src/application/d1_service.py` (replay) and
  `src/agents/d2_facade.py` (evidence arbitration).
- Change what the LLM is asked to produce: `src/prompts/registry.yaml` and
  `src/core/prompt_registry.py`.
- Add or rename a vulnerability family: `config/families.yaml` and `src/core/family_map.py`.
- Add a probe event source: `src/iast/service.py` for ingest, `probe-java/` for the agent.
- Change static analysis: `src/agents/a1_codeql_adapter.py` and the queries under
  `tools/codeql-queries/`.
- Change the HTTP surface: `src/api/routers/` for routes, `src/api/app.py` for wiring.

## Reporting issues

Run these two checks before filing; they resolve a large share of reports:

1. `uv run python tools/probe_preflight.py --workspace-id <id> --http` — if this is not `ready=true`,
   events are being dropped at ingest and every replay will look like a miss.
2. `uv run --frozen python tools/ci_gate.py` — confirms the failure is not a local environment problem.

When you open an issue, include:

- What you expected and what happened, in one or two sentences.
- The model and provider (`qwen3:8b` via Ollama, or the endpoint you used), the target
  application and how its probe is attached, and the `run_env` keys you set.
- The task's terminal `verification_status` and `failure_attribution` for the spec in question,
  plus `stage_results.a2.contract` if the LLM stage is involved. These three fields explain most
  misses without needing source access.
- Relevant log lines, not full logs.

Reports of particular value:

- A real-world target that exposes a false confirmation.
- A detected defect that cannot be confirmed, with the spec terminal state attached.
- A reproducible divergence between two runs of the same target.

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability in this project. Use GitHub's private
vulnerability reporting (Security → Report a vulnerability) instead.
