Malspark is an open-source, self-hosted platform for malware analysis. You
upload a sample, and a team of AI agents analyses it with real tools such as a
decompiler, a disassembler and a sandbox, argues over what it found, and a
judge decides the verdict. Every claim in the report cites the tool call that
proves it, so each one can be checked.

</p>

## How it works

From upload to report, with no human in the loop:

1. **Code establishes the facts first.** A deterministic triage pack
   identifies the file, hashes it, checks its signature, runs the rule engines
   and decodes its strings.
2. **Analyst agents investigate with real tools:** a decompiler, a
   disassembler, a sandbox, capture readers, reputation services. Each agent
   decides what to call and when to stop.
3. **The analysts argue.** A mediator lists every contradiction between their
   claims, and the analysts it names revise with the evidence in front of them.
4. **A judge decides** the verdict, the family and the ATT&CK techniques, and
   drops what the evidence does not support.
5. **Every claim cites the evidence.** Each tool call is written to an evidence
   ledger with an id such as `ev_0021`, and every report section names the ids
   it rests on. The ledger is sealed when the run is stored.

The output is a report against MITRE ATT&CK (Markdown, HTML, PDF), a STIX 2.1
bundle, an IOC feed and detection drafts.

The organising rule is that **the agent decides and the code says what is wrong
with the decision.** Nothing rewrites a claim, a technique id or a confidence
behind an agent's back: a problem goes back to the agent with one turn to fix
it, and what it does not fix stays on the record.

Teams, tools, models and sandboxes are configuration. Any MCP server can give
the agents its tools, and a tool Malspark has never seen is used at full
strength. Nothing is bound to Windows: the sample's own bytes decide its route.

## Benchmark

The benchmark run of 2026-11-06: Claude Haiku 5.5 with the all-tools team on a
Latrodectus sample, with a real sandbox, scored against eight public human
analyses of the family.

| Reference facts recovered | Wrong | Verified facts beyond the key | Cost |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **84 of 89** (56 found, 28 partly) | **0** | **37** | **8.24 USD** (129 model calls, 84 minutes) |

The method and the per-group scores are on the
[benchmark page](https://malspark.com/docs/benchmark/).

## The console

The web console shows each analysis in six tabs, from the Overview to the
Evidence, which holds every tool call, the analysts' discussion and the
debate. Teams and tool servers are configured in its settings.

## The teams that ship

| Team | Stages | For |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `default` | `triage_pack` → `analysis` (static, dynamic, network) → `debate` → `verdict` → `report` | The general case: three analysts, with the pack in front of them. |
| `measurement` | The same four model stages, without the pack and with every tool server withheld | What the agents contribute on their own, with nothing to call. |
| `mobile` | `triage_pack` → `triage` → `android_static` → `dynamic` → `debate` → `verdict` → `report` | An APK or a DEX. The Android stage declines on anything else and says so. |
| `deep_static` | `triage_pack` → `triage` → `static` → `reversing` → `network` → `debate` → `verdict` → `report` | Reading the code: the reversing stage takes each static finding into the decompiler. |
| `team_lead` | `triage_pack` → `lead` → `verdict` → `report` | One lead agent plans, asks the specialists through `ask_<agent>` tools, and reports what they established. |

`triage_pack` is the deterministic pre-analysis pack, which runs no model; the
`triage` stage after it is the triage *agent*. A team of your own is written in
the console; the benchmark's all-tools team is
[an importable example](docs/examples/profiles/all-tools.json).

## Quick start

The compose stack is the supported way to run Malspark. It needs Docker with
the Compose plugin, Python 3.13 and [uv](https://astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Root0ne/Malspark.git && cd Malspark
make setup                          # dependencies, pre-commit, third-party trees
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env  # fill in every secret it declares
cp bootstrap.env.example bootstrap.env  # the same secrets, for make dev-up and make migrate
make dev-up                         # docker compose up -d, development overlay
```

Create the first admin account with `make create-admin EMAIL=you@example.com`,
sign in at <http://localhost:3000>, then walk **Settings → Setup guides** to connect
a language model, a sandbox and the tools. The
[quick start](https://malspark.com/docs/getting-started/) has every command,
and [Deployment](https://malspark.com/docs/deployment/) covers production.

## Releases

Each release publishes the container images to the GitHub Container Registry
as `ghcr.io/root0ne/malspark-<name>` (`backend`, `frontend`, `minio` and the
tool sidecars), tagged `<version>` and `<major>.<minor>`, and attaches the
wheel, the sdist and `SHA256SUMS` to the
[GitHub release](https://github.com/Root0ne/Malspark/releases). The images,
the wheel and the sdist are signed with cosign keyless and carry a build
provenance attestation. [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) lists every image and the
commands that verify them.
