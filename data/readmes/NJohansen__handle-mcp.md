**Let your AI agent shop at [nemlig.com](https://www.nemlig.com), [BilkaToGo](https://www.bilkatogo.dk) and [REMA 1000](https://shop.rema1000.dk).**<br>
An MCP server for Claude, Grok or Codex. It reads the offers, plans the week on your budget and fills the cheapest cart. You pay.

**[Install →](#install)** · [handlemcp.dk](https://handlemcp.dk)

<img src="docs/demo.png" alt="Example from the demo: the agent compares nemlig.com (693 kr), REMA 1000 (712 kr) and BilkaToGo (741 kr) and fills the cheapest cart; nothing is ordered. Prices are examples" width="800">

</div>

**It can never order or pay. You do.** That code does not exist, and a test fails if it shows up ([why](docs/adr/0001-the-human-always-pays.md)).

**It counts anonymous usage, and tells you so.** No id, no personal data. Off with `HANDLE_TELEMETRY=0`. [Exactly what is sent](#usage-counts).

## How it works

1. **Plan.** Give your agent a budget. It reads this week's offers and the recipes, and plans the meals around them.
2. **Compare.** It prices the whole list in every store: pack sizes, offers, delivery fee and minimum order.
3. **Fill.** It fills the cheapest store's cart with your login. Only the cart. (At REMA 1000: your shopping list "handle-mcp".)
4. **Pay.** You open the store, check the cart, pick a delivery or pickup time and pay.

Taste, budget and meal rules live in your own prompt or skill. The server finds and counts. [Build your own skill](docs/skills.md).

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux or Windows (x64). Windows on ARM is not supported yet: a dependency (`cryptography`) has no ready-made build for it.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). It fetches Python 3.12+ if you do not have it.
- An MCP client, Grok, Claude Code, Claude Desktop or Codex etc.
- An account at nemlig.com or BilkaToGo with home delivery to your address, or at REMA 1000 (Køb & Hent or shopping in the store yourself).

## Install

```sh
uvx handle-mcp@latest login nemlig
claude mcp add handle -- uvx handle-mcp@latest
```

`@latest` runs the newest release at each start. To choose when to update, use a version instead, e.g. `handle-mcp@1.5.2` ([more](docs/setup.md)).

Then ask:

- *"We have 4,000 kr a month for food. Plan this week's meals."* It asks who eats, what you like and which store, then plans on this week's offers and fills the cheapest cart after your yes.
- *"What is on offer this week? Any free gifts?"*
- *"Which delivery times are cheapest tomorrow?"*

Other stores, Claude Desktop, headless machines and AI agents (`--from-env`): [setup](docs/setup.md). nemlig's offers and REMA 1000's search work with no login. No terminal? [Join the waitlist](https://handlemcp.dk).

## Usage counts

Anonymous counts, so we can show the stores what handle-mcp sends them. On by default. Every event has `version` and `date` (day only):

| Event | When | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `server_started` | once a day per machine | `os` |
| `first_tool_call` | the first tool call of the day (listing tools is not a call) | `tool` |
| `login_ok` | once a day per store | `store` |
| `cart_filled` | after 30 quiet minutes, only if every line went in; then nothing until the cart is empty again | `store`, `basket_total_dkk` (nearest 50 kr), `item_count` |
| `list_filled` | the same, for REMA 1000's shopping list | `store`, `basket_total_dkk`, `item_count` |

Never sent: names, addresses, phone, email, logins, product names, order ids or any id for you or your machine. Events go to [Umami Cloud](https://umami.is) over HTTPS. Umami sees your IP to answer and to guess the country; it does not save it. Sends run in the background with a 2 second timeout, and a failed send never breaks a tool. Cart links carry `utm_source=handlemcp`.

Your AI tells you once: the first tool answer on a machine has a `telemetry_notice`. The only file is `~/.config/handle-mcp/telemetry.json`: whether the notice was shown, the day each daily event was last sent, and which stores have a counted cart that is not empty yet.

Off:

```sh
HANDLE_TELEMETRY=0          # or DO_NOT_TRACK=1, or --no-telemetry
```

Your own Umami: `HANDLE_TELEMETRY_URL` and `HANDLE_TELEMETRY_WEBSITE`. Why: [ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-anonymous-usage-counts.md).
