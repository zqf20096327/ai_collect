**Your AI agent plans the week's meals on a budget, prices them at nemlig.com and BilkaToGo and fills the cheapest cart. You approve and pay.**

</div>

Danish grocery stores with home delivery, as an MCP server: [nemlig.com](https://www.nemlig.com) and [BilkaToGo](https://www.bilkatogo.dk).

**It can never order or pay. You do.** That code does not exist, and a test fails if it shows up ([why](docs/adr/0001-the-human-always-pays.md)).

## How it works

1. **Plan.** Give your agent a budget. It reads this week's offers on nemlig.com and BilkaToGo, and both stores' recipes, and plans the meals around them.
2. **Compare.** It prices the whole list in both stores: pack sizes, offers, delivery fee and minimum order.
3. **Fill.** It puts the list in the cheapest store's cart, with your login. Only the cart, nothing else.
4. **Pay.** You open nemlig.com or BilkaToGo, check the cart, pick a delivery time and pay.

Taste, budget and meal rules live in your own prompt or skill. The server finds and counts. [Build your own skill](docs/skills.md).

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux or Windows (x64). Windows on ARM is not supported yet: a dependency (`cryptography`) has no ready-made build for it.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). It fetches Python 3.12+ if you do not have it.
- An MCP client, Grok, Claude Code, Claude Desktop or Codex etc.
- An account at nemlig.com or BilkaToGo with home delivery to your address.

## Try it

```sh
uvx --from git+https://github.com/NJohansen/handle-mcp@v1.2.1 handle-mcp login nemlig
claude mcp add handle -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/NJohansen/handle-mcp@v1.2.1 handle-mcp
```

Then ask:

- *"Plan 5 dinners for 4 within 900 kr, built on this week's offers. Fill the cheapest cart."*
- *"What is on offer this week? Any free gifts?"*
- *"Which delivery times are cheapest tomorrow?"*

BilkaToGo, Claude Desktop, headless machines and AI agents (`handle-mcp login <store> --from-env`): [setup](docs/setup.md). nemlig's offers work with no login at all.
