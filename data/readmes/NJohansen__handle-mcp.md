**Let your AI agent shop at [nemlig.com](https://www.nemlig.com) and [BilkaToGo](https://www.bilkatogo.dk).**<br>
An MCP server for Claude, Grok or Codex. It reads the offers, plans the week on your budget and fills the cheapest cart. You pay.

**[Install →](#install)** · [handlemcp.dk](https://handlemcp.dk)

<img src="docs/demo.png" alt="Example from the demo: the agent compares nemlig.com (693 kr) and BilkaToGo (741 kr) and fills the cheaper cart; nothing is ordered. Prices are examples" width="800">

</div>

**It can never order or pay. You do.** That code does not exist, and a test fails if it shows up ([why](docs/adr/0001-the-human-always-pays.md)).

**It counts anonymous usage, and tells you so.** No id, no personal data. Off with `HANDLE_TELEMETRY=0`. [Exactly what is sent](#brugsstatistik).

## How it works

1. **Plan.** Give your agent a budget. It reads this week's offers on nemlig.com and BilkaToGo, and both stores' recipes, and plans the meals around them.
2. **Compare.** It prices the whole list in both stores: pack sizes, offers, delivery fee and minimum order.
3. **Fill.** It puts the list in the cheapest store's cart, with your login. Only the cart, nothing else.
4. **Pay.** You open nemlig.com or BilkaToGo, check the cart, pick a delivery time and pay.

Taste, budget and meal rules live in your own prompt or skill. The server finds and counts. [Build your own skill](docs/skills.md).

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux or Windows (x64). Windows on ARM is not supported yet: a dependency (`cryptography`) has no ready-made build for it.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). It fetches Python 3.12+ if you do not have it.
- An MCP client, Grok, Claude Code, Claude Desktop or Codex etc.
- An account at nemlig.com or BilkaToGo with home delivery to your address.

## Install

```sh
uvx handle-mcp@1.5.1 login nemlig
claude mcp add handle -- uvx handle-mcp@1.5.1
```

Then ask:

- *"Plan 5 dinners for 4 within 900 kr, built on this week's offers. Fill the cheapest cart."*
- *"What is on offer this week? Any free gifts?"*
- *"Which delivery times are cheapest tomorrow?"*

BilkaToGo, Claude Desktop, headless machines and AI agents (`handle-mcp login <store> --from-env`): [setup](docs/setup.md). nemlig's offers work with no login at all. No terminal? [Join the waitlist](https://handlemcp.dk).

## Brugsstatistik

handle-mcp counts, anonymously, how far people get from install to a filled cart, so we can show nemlig.com and BilkaToGo how many carts and kroner it sends them each week. It is on by default and easy to turn off.

What is sent, and nothing else. Every event also has `version` and `date` (day only):

| Event | When | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `server_started` | the server starts, at most once per machine per day | `os` (`darwin`, `linux` or `windows`) |
| `first_tool_call` | the first tool call of the day (a client that only lists the tools sends nothing) | `tool` (e.g. `compare_basket`) |
| `login_ok` | a store answers with your cart, at most once per store per day | `store` (`nemlig` or `bilka`) |
| `cart_filled` | once per order: after 30 minutes without changes, only when every line went in. Later edits send nothing until the cart is empty again (after checkout) | `store`, `basket_total_dkk` (rounded to the nearest 50 kr), `item_count` |

Never sent: names, addresses, phone, email, logins, product names, order ids or any id for you or your machine. The events go to [Umami Cloud](https://umami.is) over HTTPS. Umami sees your IP address to send the answer back and to guess the country; it does not save the address. Sends run with a 2 second timeout, in the background. A failed send never breaks a tool. The first tool answer on a machine has a `telemetry_notice`, so your AI tells you about it once. The only file is `~/.config/handle-mcp/telemetry.json`: whether the notice was shown, the day each daily event was last sent, and which stores have a counted cart that is not empty yet.

Cart links (`url` in the cart) carry `utm_source=handlemcp&utm_medium=mcp&utm_campaign=cart`, so the store sees the visit in its own analytics.

Turn it off with any of:

```sh
HANDLE_TELEMETRY=0          # env var
DO_NOT_TRACK=1              # the common opt-out
handle-mcp --no-telemetry   # flag
```

Send the events to your own Umami: `HANDLE_TELEMETRY_URL=https://umami.example.com/api/send` and `HANDLE_TELEMETRY_WEBSITE=<website id>`. Why and how: [docs/adr/0005](docs/adr/0005-anonymous-usage-counts.md).
