![AgentBus API docs](docs/assets/api-docs.png)

AgentBus is a cross-vendor middleware framework for coding agents. It sits between your agents and every model vendor.

## Demo

[![AgentBus demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/si0HHQFcCD0/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/si0HHQFcCD0)

Click to watch on YouTube.

## Why

- **You see every model call.** Each request and reply an agent makes passes through AgentBus and
  is stored on your machine.
- **You see the cost.** Every call is priced, and each turn and session shows its total.
- **The conversation is kept.** Each turn is a fresh one-shot agent run. AgentBus keeps the history
  and continues the conversation from its own store.
- **Any vendor.** Claude Code and codex today, through one API. Every vendor tomorrow.

AgentBus runs the agents you already have, signed in as you.

## Prerequisites

- `claude` (Claude Code) or `codex`, or both, installed and signed in.
- macOS or Linux.
- Go 1.27.1 or later, only if you install with `go install` or build from source.

## Install

Pick one.

**Homebrew:**

```sh
brew install staysup/tap/agentbus
```

**Install script** (puts `agentbus` in `~/.local/bin`):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/staysup/agentbus/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Go:**

```sh
go install github.com/staysup/agentbus/cmd/agentbus@latest
```

**Build from source:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/staysup/agentbus.git
cd agentbus
go install ./cmd/agentbus
```

On Linux, a build with cgo (the default where gcc is installed) and one without it (`CGO_ENABLED=0`, as
releases are built) both run `agentbus up` in a user namespace of their own, where a session's copy
can be an overlay mount without root. The service's first log line says whether it got one, and why
not.

Both Go routes put `agentbus` in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. That folder must be on your `PATH`:

```sh
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

Check the install with `agentbus version`.

## Quickstart

### 1. Start the service

```sh
agentbus up
```

It listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and prints its data folder:

```
agentbus: 2026/11/06 12:00:00 listening on http://127.0.0.1:8787, data folder /Users/you/.local/share/agentbus
```

The data folder is `$AGENTBUS_HOME` if set, else `$XDG_DATA_HOME/agentbus`, else
`~/.local/share/agentbus`. On first start AgentBus writes a random token to `token` in that folder,
readable only by you. Every API request needs it.

Flags:

| Flag | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `-listen` | `127.0.0.1:8787` | The address: an IP, with or without a port. With no port it uses 8787. `0.0.0.0` can be reached from the network. |
| `-origin` | none | An optional lock: allow only this browser origin, such as `http://localhost:5173`. Without it any origin may call the API. |
| `-replay` | `true` | Continue Claude and codex sessions from AgentBus's own store. `false` uses the agent's own resume. |
| `-max-runs` | `4` | How many turns run at once, 1 to 64. More wait in the queue. |

### 2. Open a cockpit

A cockpit is any client of the API. The browser cockpit is in its own repository,
[staysup/agentbus-cockpit](https://github.com/staysup/agentbus-cockpit). It works with the plain
`agentbus up` from step 1. Follow the cockpit's README, and paste the token from the token file
when it asks.

A page from any origin may call the API, because every call needs the token in a header and a
foreign page does not have it. AgentBus uses no cookies, so there is nothing for the browser to
send on your behalf. To lock the API to one origin anyway, start it with
`agentbus up -origin http://localhost:5173`.

### Reach it from another machine or a container

By default the service answers this machine only. To reach it from elsewhere, listen on every
address:

```sh
agentbus up -listen 0.0.0.0
```

In Docker, run that inside the container and publish the port to your own machine only:

```sh
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8788:8787 ...
```

The cockpit then uses `http://127.0.0.1:8788` with the same token.

On `0.0.0.0` the service can be reached from the network. The token guards every API call. The
agents' model traffic answers callers on the service's own machine only. There is no HTTPS, so
across a network use an SSH tunnel or a private network. If you put a reverse proxy in front, pass
on `/api` and `/docs` only: the proxy's requests look local to the service.

### 3. Or start a turn with curl

Open a second terminal in any folder. First check that the service finds your harnesses:

```sh
TOKEN=$(cat ~/.local/share/agentbus/token)

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v0/harnesses
```

Each one says `found`, its `version` and `signed_in`. `GET /api/v0/agents` lists your saved
agents; a new data folder has `claude` and `codex`, each on its own subscription.

`found` means the harness's program is on the service's `PATH`. `signed_in` is the harness's own
answer, and it is left out when it gives no clear one. Start a turn only with an agent whose
harness is found and signed in.

Then start a turn:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v0/turns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent":"claude","folder":"'"$PWD"'","prompt":"Say hello in five words.","model":"haiku","read_only":true}'
```

Use your own token path if the data folder is elsewhere. `folder` must be an absolute path to a
folder that exists. The agent works in its own copy of it, made exactly as the folder is now,
under the data folder, so your folder is not changed; send `"isolate":false` to work in the folder
itself. `isolation` in `permissions.toml` picks how the copy is made: `auto` (the default: one
APFS clone on macOS; on Linux an overlay mount, without root in a user namespace of its own,
else a reflink or plain copy), `overlay`, `copy`, `git` (a worktree, in a repo) or `none`. The
table of what `auto` picks, the AppArmor step Ubuntu 24.04 needs for overlay without root, and
`share_read_only` for a big `node_modules`, are in `docs/CLIENT_API.md` ("Isolation").
`model` is passed to the agent as `--model`; a small
model keeps this first turn cheap. `read_only` gives the agent read tools only. For codex, use
`"agent":"codex"` and one of its models, or leave `model` out.

The reply names the new session (`id`), the turn (`turn`) and the job that runs it (`job`):

```json
{"id":"8c1f…","turn":"t_5d0c19a2e7b3f481","job":"job_3b3d…","base_url":"http://127.0.0.1:8787/s/8c1f…/t/t_5d0c19a2e7b3f481"}
```

If the service cannot find the agent's program, the reply is HTTP 400 and nothing is stored:

```json
{"error":"agent claude cannot start: the program claude is not on the service's PATH. Install Claude Code and run claude once to sign in, then try again. If it is installed, start agentbus from a shell where claude runs."}
```

Read the turn back, with its reply, state and cost (`GET /api/v0/turns/<turn>` reads just one):

```sh
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v0/turns?session=<id>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

To make a retry safe, add `"idempotency_key":"<your id>"`. Sending the same body again returns the
same turn and starts nothing.

To continue the conversation, send the next prompt with `"session":"<id>"` and no agent or folder.

To stop a running turn, and every process it started:

```sh
curl -s -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v0/turns/<turn>/stop" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

The next turn of the session continues after it, and the agent is told that you stopped it.

## Talking to agents

A session is one conversation. You write; an agent answers. Everything else is asked for in the
chat, in plain words.

- **Saved agents.** An agent is a saved setup: a harness (`claude` or `codex`), its access (your
  subscription, or an OpenRouter key read from a variable by name), a model and a name. A new data
  folder has `claude` and `codex`. Add more with `POST /api/v0/agents`
  ([Agents](docs/CLIENT_API.md#agents)), or with "+ Agent" in the cockpit.
- **Switch model or agent on any message.** Each message may name a `model`, an `agent`, or both.
  The conversation carries on with the new one. A message that names neither keeps the last ones.
- **Messages queue.** Send the next message while a turn runs. It waits and runs after it.
- **Ask other agents.** An agent can hand work to another agent, or to many at once. It does not
  wait: it starts the work and ends its turn. **Each answer comes back as the next turn** of its
  session. Inside a turn the agent uses `agentbus-api`, which sends its turn's own token. You can
  ask in the chat: "have codex review this", "ask all three". The asked agent works in a new copy of
  your folder, without the asking session's unapplied changes. It is told which session and turn
  asked it, and reads that turn's changes, with each file's diff, through the API.
- **A copy per conversation.** Each new session works in its own copy of your folder, made as the
  folder is now, uncommitted edits included. Your folder does not change while agents work.
  Several sessions on one folder never touch each other's files. How the copy is made:
  [Isolation](docs/CLIENT_API.md#isolation).
- **Every turn has a diff.** `GET /api/v0/turns/<turn>/diff` shows each file the turn added,
  changed or removed, with each text file's own diff. Git is not asked.
- **Apply up to a turn, all or nothing.** `POST /api/v0/turns/<turn>/apply` makes your folder
  match the session at that turn. It applies every turn not yet applied, up to that one, in one
  step. It checks every file first. If a file changed in your folder since, it writes nothing and
  answers 409 with each file and why.
- **Review is optional.** Reading the diff and saying "apply" is a review. To have an agent check
  the work, ask for it. A review runs read-only in the author's copy, on another agent, and ends
  with a verdict (pass, fail or unknown) and its findings. Any P1 makes it fail.

A turn is a job, so programs and CI can do all this too: [Jobs](docs/CLIENT_API.md#jobs).

With curl, using the session from step 3:

```sh
# The next message, on another model:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v0/turns -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"session":"<id>","prompt":"Now add a test for it.","model":"sonnet"}'

# A saved agent on OpenRouter (the key stays in OPENROUTER_API_KEY, in the service's environment):
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v0/agents -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"DeepSeek","harness":"claude","access":"openrouter","model":"deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash"}'

# Hand the session to it for the next message:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v0/turns -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"session":"<id>","prompt":"Check the test.","agent":"<the new agent id>"}'

# What a turn did, then make your folder match the session at that turn:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v0/turns/<turn>/diff -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v0/turns/<turn>/apply -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Three roles, one or more machines

One program has three roles:

- **Control** keeps the API, the job queue, the record, the settings, the saved agents, the
  gateway, and a store of file contents. It never reads or writes your folder.
- **A connector** owns the folders of its machine. It takes their snapshots and applies changes
  into them.
- **A runner** runs agents, each session in its own copy.

| Command | What runs | For |
|---|---|---|
| `agentbus up` | Control, a connector and a runner, in one process | One person on one machine. The default. |
| `agentbus server` | Control alone | The machine that holds the record. |
| `agentbus connector -server <url> -folder DIR...` | A connector alone | The machine that holds the code. |
| `agentbus runner -server <url>` | A runner; with `-folder DIR`, a connector beside it | Any machine that should run agents. |

On one machine, `agentbus up` is all you need. Its copy is a clone or an overlay of your folder,
and nothing goes over HTTP. Its runner uses each harness's own sign-in, as you do.

**More machines.** Keep control and the connector on the machine with your code. Run runners
anywhere, such as in a Linux VM. Runners and connectors pull their work and are never called, so
they work behind a router.

```sh
# On the machine with the code: control, then a connector for your folders.
agentbus server -listen 0.0.0.0
agentbus connector -server http://127.0.0.1:8787 -folder ~/code/app

# On each runner machine, with the server's enroll_token file copied over (mode 0600):
agentbus runner -server http://devbox:8787 -enroll-token-file ./enroll_token
```

A runner on the same machine as its server needs its own data folder (`AGENTBUS_HOME`). For a
runner in a Lima VM and a server on the Mac's loopback, start the server with
`-host host.lima.internal`. `go run ./tools/remote` runs the whole path that way.

`agentbus server` has no folders of its own. A session names its folder by reference:
`GET /api/v0/folders` lists them, and a turn sends `folder_ref`, `connector` and
`"isolate": true` in place of `folder`. A cockpit does this for you.

File contents go through control's store, by the SHA-256 of each file, so each side sends only
what the other lacks. A runner builds a session's copy from a snapshot the connector took. At the
end of each turn it puts what changed in the store. An apply is a job of the folder's connector.

**Runners hold no secrets.** Control gives each runner turn a token of its own. The agent uses it
as its model credential. Control's gateway swaps it for the real one on the way out:

- An OpenRouter agent: control reads the key from its own environment, by the variable's name
  (`key_env`).
- A subscription agent: your own subscription, for runners on your own machines. Connect it once
  on control with `agentbus connect claude` (or Connect in the cockpit), and set
  `subscriptions_on_runners = "own"` in control's `permissions.toml`. It is off by default.

`agentbus runner -gateway local` makes a runner use its own machine's sign-in and keys instead.

A runner's turn reaches control's record while it runs: its events, model calls and replies. A
cockpit pointed at control shows it live. The runner reads its policy and instructions from
control before each turn ([Permissions](#permissions)). `-capacity` sets how many jobs it runs at
once (1 to 64, default 4).

### Network control (Linux)

Network control is off by default: agents reach any host. Turn it on in control's
`permissions.toml` with `contain = "on"` and an `allow` list:

```toml
[network]
contain = "on"
allow = ["github.com", "*.npmjs.org"]
```

Then each agent reaches only its runner's gateway, control, and the hosts in `allow`, through a
proxy. Anything else is refused and recorded as `network.refused`. It works the same for
`agentbus up` and `agentbus runner`.

It is Linux only. A runner that cannot close an agent off, such as one on a Mac, refuses the turn
with the reason. Details: `docs/CLIENT_API.md`, "Network control".

## Known limits

- **OpenRouter turns show a cost of $0.** The price table has no OpenRouter prices yet.
- **A session stays on one runner.** Its copy lives there, so its later turns go to the same
  runner. Moving a session between runners comes later.
- **Copies on shared or network disks are slow.** A copy is a clone (APFS) or a reflink (xfs,
  btrfs) only when the folder and the data folder are on the same disk that can make one.
  Elsewhere, such as a network disk, every file is copied byte by byte.
- **Keep the data folder on a disk that keeps exact file times.** Some disks keep a file's time
  only to the second, such as a Mac folder shared into Docker, a network share or FAT. With the
  data folder there, every apply of a changed file is refused as "changed in your folder", even
  when it is not. Put the data folder (`AGENTBUS_HOME`) on the machine's own disk.
- **A first transfer of a big folder is slow.** A runner on another machine gets a 50,000-file
  folder (414 MB) in about 30 s the first time. Later sessions send only what changed: about 4 s.
- **Network control is Linux-only, and off by default.** On macOS, `contain = "on"` refuses
  every turn.
- **Not yet tested on Ubuntu 24.04**, which restricts user namespaces. Network control and the
  rootless overlay may need its AppArmor profile there (`install.sh` prints the command).
- **An asked agent reads the asker's changes but cannot run them.** Its copy is made from your
  folder, so "have codex review this" gets the diff of the asking turn through the API, not those
  files in its copy. Tests it runs run on your folder as it is. A copy started from the asking
  session's latest checkpoint is a later option.
- **codex on a subscription cannot run on a remote runner yet.** Control cannot add codex's
  ChatGPT sign-in, so such a turn is refused before it starts. Use an OpenRouter agent there, or
  `agentbus up`.

## Docs

The running service describes its own API. None of these need the token or the internet:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8787/docs`: an interactive reference.
- `http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v0/openapi.json`: the OpenAPI 3.1 description. Generate a client from
  it in any language. There are no client SDKs.
- `http://127.0.0.1:8787/docs/llms.txt`: one plain file for coding agents.

The contract in words is [docs/CLIENT_API.md](docs/CLIENT_API.md).

## Your data

Everything stays on your machine, in the data folder: `events.db` (a SQLite file, the record),
`jobs.db` (the job queue), `token`, `turns_token`, `enroll_token`, `runner.json`,
`connector.json`, `folders.json`, `permissions.toml`, `instructions.md`, `agents.json`, `blobs/`,
`worktrees/` and `logs/`. `turns_token` is a second token for a program that only starts, stops
and reads turns. `enroll_token` adds a runner or a connector; the built-in ones read it, and keep
their identities in `runner.json` and `connector.json`. `blobs/` is control's store of file
contents. `worktrees/` holds the copies and git worktrees sessions run in. `subscriptions/`
appears once you connect a subscription; its files are readable by you only. Nothing is sent
anywhere except the model calls themselves, to the vendor your agent already uses.

`events.db` holds each turn's model requests and replies, so it holds whatever your agent read or
printed during a turn, such as a file it opened or a command's output. It is not encrypted, and it
is kept until you remove it. Request headers, including your sign-in, are never stored.

To clear it, stop `agentbus up` and delete the data folder. A new one is made on the next start.

## Permissions

A turn runs with no person to click "allow". So a claude turn is refused anything that needs a
"may I?", such as `go test` or reading a folder outside its own. `permissions.toml` in the data
folder says what turns may do:

```toml
read_folders = ["~/.agents"]           # claude may Read, Grep and Glob there
allow = ["go test", "make test"]       # claude gets --allowedTools Bash(go test:*),...
forbid = ["git push", "git checkout"]  # the gateway refuses these, for claude and codex
edit = "session"                       # where a turn may edit files: "session" or "none"
subagents = true                       # false: no turn starts the agent's own subagents

[limits]                     # work agents ask other agents for
max_depth = 2                # levels of asking below your turn
max_jobs_per_turn = 10       # jobs one turn may ask for
max_jobs_per_tree = 30       # jobs everything started from one of your sessions may ask for
max_cost_usd_per_tree = 0.0  # dollars that work may cost before asking stops; 0 is off

[agent_api]                  # what a turn's own token may do
scope = "tree"               # "tree": its request tree; "session": its own session only
read = true                  # read sessions, turns, calls and jobs
list_agents = true           # list saved agents and harnesses
start = true                 # start a session on a saved agent
continue = true              # continue a session its tree started
review = true                # ask for a review
cancel = true                # cancel what it asked for
rename = true                # rename sessions
```

`agentbus up` makes it with empty lists and every other value at its default, as above. A key you
leave out reads as its default, so an older file keeps working. Every turn reads the file when it
starts, and the API reads it for every request a turn's token sends, so an edit applies at once.
A broken file stops the turn with the line and the problem.

**Through the API.** `GET /api/v0/settings/permissions` reads the policy as JSON, and `PUT` writes
it back. A `PUT` sends the `ETag` of its `GET` in `If-Match`, so it never undoes a hand edit made in
between: that gets 412. Only the main token may do this. A turn's own token can never read or
change the policy. Details: [docs/CLIENT_API.md](docs/CLIENT_API.md#settings).

**On a runner.** `agentbus runner -server <url>` reads the server's policy before each turn, not a
file of its own, so one policy holds on every machine. If it cannot reach the server, the turn
does not start and the job fails with that reason. It never runs on an older copy.

**Edits.** With `edit = "session"`, a turn edits files in its own session folder (its copy)
without asking: claude gets `Edit(//<folder>/**)`, codex runs with `--sandbox workspace-write`.
`"none"` edits nothing: claude is denied Edit, Write and NotebookEdit, whatever your own Claude
Code settings allow, and codex runs read-only, with no network. A `read_only` turn never
edits. No turn may edit the data folder's own files (this file, `instructions.md`, `agents.json`,
the tokens): a turn that could would raise its own limits. That rule is not a setting. It covers
the tools that edit files: a command in `allow` that runs any code (`python3`, `node`, `sh`) can
still write them, so allow only commands you would let change your policy.

**Subagents.** With `subagents = false`, a turn cannot start the agent's own subagents. claude
gets `--disallowedTools Task,Agent,Workflow`, and codex runs with `--disable multi_agent --disable
multi_agent_v2`. Both are flags of that turn only: your `~/.claude/settings.json` and
`~/.codex/config.toml` are never changed. The default, `true`, changes nothing.

**Limits.** A request past a limit is refused, and the refusal names the limit.

`read_folders` grants reads only in the default and acceptEdits modes. Under your own Claude Code
"auto" mode, claude may still write there.
A `read_only` turn stays read-only.

`forbid` works for claude and codex. The gateway reads each model reply. When a shell command in
it matches an entry, the agent never gets that call, and the model is told a rule refused it. Each
command in a chain is checked on its own, so `cd repo && git -C repo push` matches `git push`.
Every refusal is stored as a `tool.refused` event. claude also gets `--disallowedTools`.

The guard reads the command text. It cannot see a command built while the agent runs, or one run
from a script the agent wrote earlier. For a hard rule, also take away what the command needs. For
"never push", give the agent no push credentials.

codex gets nothing from `read_folders` and `allow`. Its sandbox can read every folder already.
Details: [docs/CLIENT_API.md](docs/CLIENT_API.md#permissionstoml).

## Instructions

Every turn gets the same short instructions, as an instruction of its agent's own (Claude Code's
`--append-system-prompt`, codex's `developer_instructions`), never inside your prompt. They are the
text of `instructions.md` in the data folder. `agentbus up` writes it with the default: how to
search the session's earlier turns and ask other agents with `agentbus-api`. Edit it to change what
every agent is told; `{session}` becomes the session id. An empty file gives no instructions, and a
missing one the default. Each turn reads it when it starts. Keep it the same within a session, so
the prompt cache holds. `GET` and `PUT /api/v0/settings/instructions` read and write it through the
API, and a runner on another machine uses its server's.

## How it works

- **The agent changes one setting**, its API address. It also gets the instructions in
  `instructions.md` (Claude Code's `--append-system-prompt`, codex's `developer_instructions`),
  saying how to search its session's earlier turns and ask other agents with the turn's own token.
  Your prompt is never changed.
- **Traffic passes through.** Requests go to the vendor with their headers, so the agent's own
  sign-in is used. Headers are never stored. The one change: a turn that continues a session gets
  the earlier turns' history put in front of its requests. For codex, the earlier turn's thread id
  also replaces the new one, so the vendor reads the history from its cache.
- **Adapters read a copy** of each body and turn the vendor's format into the same events.
- **Your sign-in stays on your machine.** Agents reach the service on loopback, even when it
  listens on `0.0.0.0`, and the model traffic answers callers on that machine only.
