Roamies is a little AI buddy that lives on your desktop. It stays by your cursor, talks back in its own
voice, keeps track of what you said you'd do and nudges you when it's due.

> ⭐ **If Roamies keeps you on track, give it a star.** It's the main way other people find it.

## Why Roamies

- **Talk, don't type.** Hold ⌃⌥ (Ctrl+Alt on Windows), say it, let go.
- **It talks back.** Spoken replies in its own voice, with real feeling, through [Fish Audio](https://fish.audio).
- **It remembers.** What you said you'd do, reminders down to the second, and what matters to you.
- **It sees and points.** Reads any window and points at exactly where to click.
- **It does the clicking.** Opens apps, sites and files, and clicks or types in other apps for you.
- **Your subscriptions.** Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Kimi or API keys.

| Pick your Roamie | What you get                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JARVIS**       | **A glowing sphere of light that ripples as it speaks** |
| Roamie           | The original: a tiny glowing pixel creature             |
| Anime Girl       | A pixel anime girl                                      |
| Sarah            | A pixel woman                                           |
| Adrian           | A pixel man                                             |

<sub>Each one has its own name, voice and animations, in three sizes: Default, Small, or Cursor, a pixel pointer that rides along with your mouse.</sub>

## Also included

- **The Roamies panel:** click the menu bar or tray icon for what it's doing, what it remembers, and every setting.
- **Safe by default:** file edits, commands and app control stay off until you turn them on, and risky steps always ask.
- **Shows its work:** every tool plays its own animation, so you can see what it's doing.
- **Private keys:** your Fish Audio key stays in the macOS Keychain or encrypted on Windows, never in a file.
- **Out of the way:** no Dock icon, ⌃⌥S shows or hides it, Esc stops a reply.
- **Updates itself:** signed updates, installed in one click.
- **Quick setup:** permissions, sign-in and a short chat so it gets to know you.

Windows uses [NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3)

## Get started

1. Install Roamies:

   **macOS (Apple silicon or Intel):** [Download the latest release](https://github.com/KenKaiii/Roamies/releases/latest) and open the `.dmg` for your Mac (`aarch64` for Apple silicon, `x64` for Intel).

   **Windows:** [Download the latest release](https://github.com/KenKaiii/Roamies/releases/latest) and run the `.exe` installer. It isn't code-signed yet, so Windows shows a SmartScreen warning the first time.

   **Development:** With Rust, Node.js 22+, the [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) and, on macOS, the Xcode Command Line Tools installed:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KenKaiii/Roamies.git
   cd Roamies/showcase/tauri
   (cd sidecar && npm ci && npm test)
   ./build.sh dev        # debug build
   ./build.sh            # release bundle for this OS
   ```

2. Open the app, follow the setup guide, pick your Roamie, and hold ⌃⌥ to say hi.

## Build with the framework

Every Roamie's brain is a [gg-framework](https://github.com/KenKaiii/gg-framework) agent running in a Node
sidecar. Want to build your own? Install just what you need.

- [**@kenkaiiii/gg-ai**](https://github.com/KenKaiii/gg-framework/blob/main/packages/gg-ai/README.md): Connect to AI providers and stream responses.
- [**@kenkaiiii/gg-agent**](https://github.com/KenKaiii/gg-framework/blob/main/packages/gg-agent/README.md): Build agents that use your tools and work through tasks.
- [**@kenkaiiii/gg-core**](https://github.com/KenKaiii/gg-framework/blob/main/packages/gg-core/README.md): Model selection, authentication, and local model discovery.

For your own agent, start here:

```bash
npm install @kenkaiiii/gg-ai @kenkaiiii/gg-agent
```
