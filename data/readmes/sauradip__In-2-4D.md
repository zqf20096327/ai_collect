### Abstract
We propose a new problem, In-2-4D, for generative 4D (i.e., 3D + motion) inbetweening from a minimalistic input setting: two single-view images capturing an object in two distinct motion states. Given two images representing the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to generate and reconstruct the motion in 4D. We utilize a video interpolation model to predict the motion, but large frame-to-frame motions can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To overcome this, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states and show significant motion, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct the 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting. The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic Gaussians through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions.

### News
- 2026.Oct.30: Open-sourced In-2-4D model with updated backbones and configurations.

### Install
The third-party code lives in git submodules under `third_party/`, pinned to the tested commits. It is never edited;
changes are applied at import time from `patches/`. The stages need conflicting pins, so there are three conda envs:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sauradip/In-2-4D.git && cd In-2-4D
./run.sh setup          
```

### Pretrained weights
Download all models with one script (files already present are skipped):
```bash
bash download_weights.sh                 # add --distilled for the 4-step Wan model, --ltx for the LTX-Video backbone
```
Large checkpoints (Wan2.2-I2V-A14B, SAM 2.1, Wan2.2-Lightning, LTX-Video, DynamicCrafter) go to `checkpoints/`; Qwen2.5-VL-7B,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, Era3D, Depth-Anything-V2, CoTracker3 and the matting models go to the standard Hugging Face /
torch hub caches.

### Inference
Pick two images of the same object in its start and end state, on a plain background. We provide an example in the
`data_test` folder.

1. Generate the 4D object (all steps, s0-s9):
```sh
./run.sh flower data_test/flower/start.png data_test/flower/end.png
```
Faster, with the 4-step distilled video model (video sampling ~3 min instead of ~33 min per clip on 4× T4):
```sh
IN24D_CFG=configs/t4x4_distilled.yaml ./run.sh flower data_test/flower/start.png data_test/flower/end.png
```

2. Render novel-view videos (`outputs/flower/novel_view_videos/grid.mp4` and `orbit.mp4`):
```sh
./run.sh video flower --with_input --elevations 0 30
```

Results for each case go to `outputs/<case>/`:
```
video/              inputs, motion caption, generated in-between video, motion progress, clips  
multiview/          multi-view images of every clip frame                                        
4d/                 4D Gaussians (reconstruction/ merge/ refinement/), rendered views and metrics
novel_view_videos/  grid.mp4 and orbit.mp4 from ./run.sh video
```
