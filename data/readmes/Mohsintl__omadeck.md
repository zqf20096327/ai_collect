### ⚡ At a Glance

| Question | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **What is it?** | A self-hosted Web App (PWA) that acts like a physical Stream Deck + AI voice remote for Linux. |
| **Who is it for?** | Omarchy, Arch Linux, and Hyprland users who want tactile desk control or couch remote power. |
| **Why not a physical deck?** | Physical decks cost $150+, have fixed buttons, and lack Wayland awareness. OmaDeck uses your existing phone, has 5 context profiles, OLED themes, and direct PC voice typing. |
| **Supported Devices** | Tested on iPhone and iPad. Android Chrome should work but hasn't been tested yet. Zero app store installs. |
| **Privacy & Connection** | Runs on your own network, with HTTPS once the local CA is installed, and token/PIN authentication. Works offline, though cloud APIs are more accurate. |

---

## 💡 Why OmaDeck?

Most Linux remote tools are either clunky VNC viewers that eat battery, or single-purpose media remotes that can't interact with modern Wayland compositors.

| The Problem | How OmaDeck Solves It |
|:---|:---|
| Reaching for the keyboard just to switch workspaces or adjust volume while relaxing. | **One-tap touch grid**: Instant Hyprland workspace jumps, window moves, and scratchpad toggles. |
| Typing long URLs, prompts, or text on the PC from across the room. | **Direct PC Typing**: Type or dictate via your phone's native speech keyboard straight into the focused PC window. |
| A dev server or port `:3000` is hanging your system. | **One-tap Process Killer**: Kill `:3000`, `:8000`, or launch the crosshair window terminator with 1 tap. |
| Physical macro pads cost $150+ and require proprietary drivers. | **Zero Hardware Cost**: Turn any spare or current phone into an OLED macro board with haptic feedback. |
| Most AI voice assistants send everything to a proprietary cloud. | **Universal AI Engine**: Bring your own Groq, Ollama (100% local/offline), OpenAI, DeepSeek, or custom endpoint. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

- **On the PC:** Omarchy, or Arch with Hyprland, with `hyprctl` and `wtype`. Python 3.11 or newer; the phone deck needs no Python packages of its own.
- **On the phone:** iPhone or iPad with Safari (tested), or Android with Chrome (should work, not tested yet).
- **The network:** the phone and the PC on the same Wi-Fi or LAN, or the same Tailscale network. The deck listens on port `8765`.
- **Optional:** `qrencode` for the pairing QR code, and an API key (Groq, OpenAI and others) or a local Ollama for voice and AI.

The installer runs as your user and puts everything under your home folder. It only asks for `sudo` to install packages with pacman, or for the optional `omarchy voice ...` commands. [Uninstalling](#-uninstall) removes all of it.

### 1. Installation

Clone and install on your Omarchy machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohsintl/omadeck.git
cd omadeck
./install.sh --quick
```

`--quick` sets up just the phone deck without any questions: the `omadeck` command, the phone page as a background service that starts when you log in, and `qrencode` for the pairing QR code. It then shows the pairing QR code.

Run `./install.sh` without `--quick` to choose each part yourself, including the extras: the voice daemon and its service, the bar widget, the `omarchy voice ...` commands, and the SUPER + SHIFT + V keybinding. You can run it again at any time to add them.

### 2. Connect from Your Phone

Run this in a terminal, and it walks you through setting up your phone. If the background service is running, it just shows the steps. If it isn't, it also starts the server until you press Ctrl+C:
```bash
omadeck mobile
```
You will see output similar to:
```text
  Scan this with your phone's camera. It walks you through the rest:
  the certificate (once per phone), opening the deck, and adding it
  to your Home Screen.
    [QR code]
    http://192.168.1.50:8765/pair#token=<token>
    Certificate fingerprint: 8A:3F:B2:91:...
    Keep this link private: anyone with it can control your desktop.
```
The QR code opens a setup page on the phone. It downloads the certificate with the steps for iPhone or Android, checks that the phone now trusts it, then opens the deck over HTTPS. The token is after the `#`, which the phone never sends over the network. Still, treat the link and QR code like a password. The service log leaves the token out and shows only the certificate fingerprint.

To get the QR code, say yes when the installer offers `qrencode`, or install it later with `sudo pacman -S qrencode`. The links work without it.

#### Step-by-Step Connection Guide:
1. **Install CA Certificate for Encrypted HTTPS & Microphone**:
   - Modern mobile browsers (iOS Safari & Android Chrome) **strictly require HTTPS** for microphone access (`getUserMedia`).
   - On your phone connected to the same Wi-Fi, open `http://<your-laptop-lan-ip>:8765/ca.crt` (or tap the setup banner) to download OmaDeck's scoped root CA.
   - **iOS**: Open **Settings ➔ Profile Downloaded ➔ Install**, then enable **Settings ➔ General ➔ About ➔ Certificate Trust Settings ➔ Enable Full Trust for "Oma Remote CA"**.
   - **Android**: Open **Settings ➔ Security ➔ Encryption & Credentials ➔ Install a Certificate ➔ CA Certificate**.
   - *Upgrade Note*: If you are upgrading from an earlier OmaDeck version, install the new certificate profile as the CA is now restricted with strict name constraints (`.local`, `.ts.net`, and private subnets).
2. **Connect & Pair Securely (HTTPS)**:
   - Open `https://<your-laptop-lan-ip>:8765/?token=<token>` (or scan the QR code, if `qrencode` is installed).
   - HTTPS ensures your pairing token, PIN, dictation audio, and window commands are fully encrypted across your local network.
3. **PWA Standalone App**:
   - In Safari, tap **Share ➔ Add to Home Screen**. In Chrome on Android, tap **⋮ ➔ Install app**. **Add to Home screen** only makes a shortcut that opens in Chrome, and **Install app** only appears once the certificate is trusted.
   - This launches OmaDeck in fullscreen mode without URL address bars, providing an authentic hardware Stream Deck experience with haptic vibrations.

## 🔒 Network Security & Privacy Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OmaDeck provides direct input execution (virtual typing and shell triggers via `hyprctl` and `wtype`) onto your Linux desktop.

- **Local Network Only**: Never port-forward port `8765` directly through your home router or expose it to the public internet.
- **PIN Session Lock**: If you share your Wi-Fi network (or use public/office networks), go to **Settings ➔ Security** and configure a 4-to-8 digit PIN lock. This prevents anyone on the subnet from controlling your desktop.
- **Remote Access Outside Home**: To control your desktop securely while away from home, use a private encrypted mesh VPN such as **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)** or **WireGuard** instead of public port forwarding.

### What OmaDeck does and doesn't protect against

OmaDeck is built for a network you trust, such as your home Wi-Fi. Anyone holding your pairing link can control your desktop.

**In place:**
- **Shell access is off by default** (`allow_shell = false`). The assistant can't run commands or press Enter in a recognised terminal.
- **Untrusted text is held back.** For 2 minutes after the assistant reads a screen, terminal, web page, or clipboard, commands and saved notes need your spoken confirmation.
- **Secrets stay off plain HTTP.** PINs and API keys are refused over HTTP when HTTPS is available.
- **Limits on abuse.** PIN guesses are rate limited, connections are capped per address, and slow clients are cut off.

**Known limits:**
- **Plain HTTP still works for touch controls**, so phones without the CA can use the deck. On that connection your token and commands aren't encrypted, so use HTTPS on any network you share.
- **Prompt injection is reduced, not solved.** Text on a page could still steer ordinary clicks and typing. Be careful using the assistant on pages you don't trust.
- **The command denylist isn't a sandbox.** With `allow_shell` on, a script already on disk can do anything your user can. Leave it off unless you need it.
- **The terminal guard goes by window type.** It doesn't recognise terminals built into editors, such as VS Code's.
- **Someone on your network can block PIN login** for up to 24 hours by failing it repeatedly. Your pairing link keeps working.

## 🧪 Tested Compatibility

| Component | Tested on |
|:---|:---|
| **Linux** | Omarchy |
| **Compositor** | Hyprland 0.56.2. Requires `hyprctl` and `wtype`. |
| **Phone and tablet** | iPhone and iPad |

Other Hyprland setups and Android Chrome may work but haven't been tested yet. Reports are welcome in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Mohsintl/omadeck/issues).

**Offline use:** everything works offline with local models, but voice and AI results are less accurate than with a cloud API.

### Tested end to end

The phone deck has end-to-end tests built with [e2e](https://e2e.com). They open the deck in a phone-sized browser, tap the keys, and check what reached the desktop. The desktop is fake: `hyprctl` and `wtype` stand-ins log each call, so the tests run on any machine, and CI runs them on every pull request alongside 400+ unit tests.

OmaDeck is featured as a community example on e2e: **[Testing OmaDeck's phone deck with e2e](https://e2e.com/examples/omadeck)**. To run the tests yourself, see [`e2e/README.md`](e2e/README.md).

## ⚙️ Interactive Settings & AI Configuration

Configure your AI provider, mic triggers, and OLED themes from either your PC or phone:

<div align="center">

| ⚙️ AI Keys & Settings | 🎨 24 OLED Themes & Auto-Sync |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="docs/images/settings-tokyo-night.png" width="350" alt="OmaDeck AI Settings Modal (Tokyo Night)" /> | <img src="docs/images/themes-tokyo-night.png" width="350" alt="OmaDeck Themes Modal (Tokyo Night)" /> |

</div>

* **On PC**: Run `omadeck settings` in terminal to launch the settings panel.
* **On Phone**: Tap the **⚙️** gear icon in the top navigation bar.

In the **API Keys** pane:
- Select your provider (**Groq**, **Ollama**, **OpenAI**, **OpenRouter**, **DeepSeek**, **Mistral**, **NVIDIA**, or **Custom**).
- Choose your **Mic Activation** style (**Hold to talk**, **Tap to talk**, or **Both tap & hold**).
- Enable **AI Dictation Polishing** to automatically strip filler words ("um", "uh") and fix formatting.
- Paste your API key (stored in `~/.config/omarchy-voice/env` with `chmod 600`).
- Tap **"Test & Save Keys"** to verify connection live before saving.

---

## 🖥️ Desktop Commands

```bash
# Show your pairing link
omadeck mobile

# Restart everything (the voice daemon and the phone page), e.g. after an update
omadeck restart

# What it heard, what the AI did, and every phone button press, live
omadeck log -f

# Check every moving part
omadeck doctor

# Try a command without speaking
omadeck say "go to workspace 2"
```

### Updating

```bash
omadeck update
```

This pulls the folder you installed from, copies the new code into place and restarts OmaDeck, without asking the installer's questions again. Your settings, keys and pairing stay. It stops without changing anything if that folder has changes you haven't committed.

The services run a copy of the code, so `git pull` on its own changes nothing. If you installed before `omadeck update` existed, update the long way once:

```bash
cd omadeck
git pull
./install.sh
omadeck restart
```

Answer **N** to the installer's questions on a re-install. After that, `omadeck update` works.

---

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

Start with `omadeck doctor`, which checks every moving part, and `omadeck log -f`, which shows each button press and voice command as it happens.

| What you see | What to do |
|:---|:---|
| The deck loads on the PC but times out on the phone | The firewall is probably blocking it. Omarchy turns on `ufw`, so allow the port with `sudo ufw allow 8765/tcp`. `omadeck mobile` warns about this when it spots it. Also check that the phone is on the same Wi-Fi, not mobile data. |
| The browser warns that the connection isn't private | The certificate isn't trusted yet. Do step 1 of `omadeck mobile` again; on iPhone, also turn on full trust in **Settings ➔ General ➔ About ➔ Certificate Trust Settings**. |
| The mic doesn't work | Browsers only allow the mic over HTTPS. Open the `https://` link, not the `http://` one, after installing the certificate. |
| The deck asks for the "Desktop Pairing Token" | The link is missing its `?token=...`, or the token changed. Scan the QR code from `omadeck mobile` again. |
| The Home Screen icon shows the old logo | Remove the icon from the Home Screen and add it again; iOS keeps the old one. |
| Buttons do nothing on the PC | Check that `hyprctl` and `wtype` are installed, then run `omadeck restart`. |

Still stuck? [Open an issue](https://github.com/Mohsintl/omadeck/issues) with the output of `omadeck doctor`.

---

## 🧹 Uninstall

```bash
cd omadeck
./uninstall.sh
```

It stops and removes the services, the `omadeck` command, the installed code, the bar widget and the keybinding it added. It backs up `bindings.lua` and `shell.json` before changing them. Your settings, API keys and certificates stay in `~/.config/omarchy-voice` so a re-install keeps your pairing.

To remove those as well:

```bash
./uninstall.sh --purge
```

Then delete the "Oma Remote CA" certificate from your phone: on iPhone, **Settings ➔ General ➔ VPN & Device Management**.
