## Try it

**[Open it online](https://daddaiz.github.io/StCardCreator/)**: no download, runs in your browser.

> **Phone and tablet:** the layout for small screens is **not tested and does not work well**. ST Card Creator is meant for a computer.

## Download

Go to **Releases** and pick one:

- **ST-Card-Creator.exe** for Windows. Portable, no install.
- **ST-Card-Creator.html** for any browser. One file, nothing to install.

> **Windows warning:** the exe is not code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen may say it "prevented an unrecognized app from starting". Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. If you prefer not to, use the online version or the HTML file: they do the same thing.

## What it does

The start screen has six buttons: **New Card**, **Import** (a card PNG or JSON), **Edit your PNG** (decorate a ready image), **Cards** (your saved cards), **IA Generation** and **Resume** (continue the card you were working on). Dark and light themes, English and Italian.

### Write the card
Every SillyTavern field in one clean page: description, personality, scenario, first messages, dialogue examples, advanced definitions, lorebook, creator's metadata. Token counts update as you type, and a 🪄 wand next to each field can improve your text with AI. Drafts are saved automatically, and every AI action can be undone. The preview shows the finished cover; hover it and the card flips to show a checklist of every field with its token count.

### Design the cover
Pick an image, add the name and a short line, choose fonts, frames and masks. Export a PNG with the card data embedded (`chara` and `ccv3`), or the JSON on its own. The **Thumbnails** button shows how the cover looks at 140, 100 and 64 px. Bring your own image with **Upload PNG** (the app does not generate images). You can also import any existing card, or just decorate a ready image.

### Keep all your cards
Every draft is saved in your browser. The **Cards** window shows them as a grid, newest first, with image and token count. Edit loads a card back into the editor, Delete asks before removing it.

### Let the AI draft it
Write an idea in any language. Choose which fields to write, and watch the progress bar fill as each one is done. Everything comes out in English, field by field, with the right rules for each.

### Add it to SillyTavern (exe only)
In the Windows exe, **Add to SillyTavern** sends the card straight into your SillyTavern, and **SillyTavern cards** lists the ones already there so you can edit and update them. SillyTavern must be running. If it asks for a login, enter your SillyTavern username and password in the API page. After adding or updating, reload the SillyTavern page (F5) to see the change. In the browser versions these buttons stay off.

### Image prompts
Tick **Stable diffusion**, choose your image model, and get ready-to-paste prompts for the character and for the first message scene. They follow the style each model likes: natural language, FLUX, SDXL/SD3, Pony tags, anime tags. These prompts are not part of the card: you make the image with your own tool, then upload it as the cover. If you host it online, one click adds `![](URL)` under the first message.

## AI setup

The AI features need an API, set in the **API** tab: OpenRouter, NanoGPT, OpenAI, Anthropic, or any OpenAI-compatible server (including local ones). Your key stays in your browser and is only saved if you tick "Remember". Without an API you can still write and export cards; only the wand and generation are off.
