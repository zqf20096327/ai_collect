## What it does

You type one sentence. Blueprint grows a team to do it:

- A **Lead Producer** figures out what you actually want and breaks the work into stages.
- Each stage gets a **lead**, who splits it into parts and sets up a workspace for each one.
- Parts that are still big get their own lead. Parts that are one piece go to a **specialist** who builds it end to end.
- Results flow back up and get integrated, layer by layer, into one finished product.

No fixed roles, no workflow to draw. The structure grows from the task: a game might grow art, combat, levels and sound; a report grows research, data and writing.

And you see all of it. Every agent is a card on the canvas: what it's doing, where it's stuck, what it made, what it reported. Click any one to read its work or talk to it.

## Same prompt, different setups

Each game started from the same one-line prompt (written in Chinese), handed to every setup as is.

**Top-down shooter and tower defense**

<summary>The prompts (translated)</summary>

- **Top-down shooter:** Mix Project Zomboid with Diablo-style looting into a top-down 3D horde shooter. An open parking lot at night: heavy atmosphere, strong effects, great shooting feel, strong art.
- **Tower defense:** A sci-fi tower defense game with high-end art: realistic pixel-art texture, rich detail, rich effects, strong atmosphere and immersion.
- **Boss fight:** Create an epic boss-fight scene like Demon's Souls: grand and magnificent, with an oppressive atmosphere and music, an exquisitely detailed, awe-inspiring enemy, exaggerated moves and English voice lines, and a tiny hero with only limited attacks. Focus on level art, atmosphere, epic scale and splendor. (Outdoor level)

## Features

- **Live canvas.** The whole team on one map. Color is status: running, waiting, needs you, done. Switch between rounds and stages.
- **Step in anytime.** Talk to any agent. Stop one without stopping the rest. Restart one, with or without its changes.
- **You choose how involved you are.** *Leave it all to you*, *Just check the result*, *Work together*, or *Deeply involved*. Change it anytime.
- **Every agent gets its own workspace.** Its own git branch, only its slice of the project checked out, plus the tools to test its part. Work gets merged back when it's done.
- **Bring your own workers.** Agents run on any model you connect. Big pieces can also go to Codex or Claude Code on your machine.
- **Plug in what you need.** 20+ skills (Godot, Blender, Three.js, Phaser, FFmpeg, Word/Excel/PowerPoint, and more), image/video/audio APIs, and one-click install of local tools.

## Quick start

1. Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/wbohui123-sys/blueprint/releases/latest). Apple Silicon Macs only for now.
2. Drag Blueprint into Applications and open it. The app isn't notarized yet, so macOS will block the first launch: go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**. If macOS says the app is damaged, run:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/Blueprint.app
   ```
3. Add an API key. DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, multi-model gateways, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
4. Type what you want, hit **Start building →**, and watch it grow.

Big tasks run for tens of minutes to hours and use a lot of tokens. Start with something small, and check **Project usage** in the top bar to see time and cost.

Everything else is in the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md).

## How it works

```
Your goal
└─ Lead Producer        what do you want? how many stages?
   └─ Stage lead        split into parts, set up a workspace for each
      ├─ Lead           still big? split again
      │  └─ Specialist  build it, test it, hand it back
      └─ Specialist     (any model, Codex, or Claude Code)
         ↑ results flow back up and get integrated
```

Before every step, each lead asks itself one question: *what should I do next?* Figure out the problem, plan, build, integrate, or check the result. It's a loop the agent drives, not a fixed pipeline.

Every agent hands back the same report: what it did, how it checked it, what it couldn't check, and what needs a human. That's what lets dozens of agents work in parallel without losing track of each other.

## Limitations

- macOS on Apple Silicon only.
- Not notarized. The first launch needs the extra step above.
- Can't click around websites or control other desktop apps yet. It can screenshot and look at pages.
- Codex and Claude Code workers are one-shot: they can't take messages halfway through.
- Young project. Expect rough edges and bugs.

## Build from source

Requires an Apple Silicon Mac and Node 22.19+.

```bash
npm --prefix app ci
npm --prefix app start
```

Packaging and tests: [app/README.md](app/README.md).

Blueprint is a set of plugins on top of [DeepSeek Harness (dsh)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). Plain JavaScript, no build step.
