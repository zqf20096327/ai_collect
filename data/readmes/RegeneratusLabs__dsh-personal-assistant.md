# dsh-personal-assistant

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

A personal AI assistant built by **composing pinned plugins on [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH)** — no fork, no custom agent loop. This repository is both the build and its public engineering log: every decision, plugin admission, security control, failure and fix is recorded under [`research/`](research/).

**Status:** M0 (security & telemetry) ✅ · M0.5 (plugin admission) ✅ · M1 (curated stack) 🟨 — identity, memory, recall, push and heartbeat are live; the Telegram channel is **on hold** pending an upstream delivery fix.

## Build your own with your DSH agent

This repo is a working reference, not an installer: **point your own DSH agent at it and it builds the same
kind of assistant for you** — on your host, with your paths and your persona, asking you before every
host-level change.

- Start here: [`agents/README.md`](agents/README.md) — what the agent will build, prerequisites, ground rules.
- Copy-paste brief: [`agents/PROMPT.md`](agents/PROMPT.md) (fill in your profile/home/port).
- Process and gates: [`agents/GUIDE.md`](agents/GUIDE.md) + [`agents/checklists.md`](agents/checklists.md).

The engineering log in `research/` is the "why" behind every step, including what failed and what was
rejected. The reference persona and path names are examples — your agent should write yours, not copy them.

## What it does today

| Layer | Component | State |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | `@local/dsh-soul` + [`soul/SOUL.md`](soul/SOUL.md) — persona, tone, untrusted-content and approval rules injected at prompt order 0 | live |
| Long-term memory | `@vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents@0.8.6`, self-hosted Hindsight on `127.0.0.1:9177`, bank `dsh-personal` only | live |
| Session recall | `@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-session-search@0.2.2-rc.2` (FTS5 index, durable file) | live |
| Phone push | `@local/dsh-push` — ntfy notifications on turn/approval/question, no message bodies | installed, inert until `NTFY_URL` |
| Proactivity | `@local/dsh-heartbeat` — quiet, default-OFF loop with quiet hours and change-gated nudges | installed, disabled by design |
| Connectors | official `mcp-manager` (rc.2) + a local `ping` MCP fixture; `GET /api/capabilities` is owner-gated | live (fixture); first Western connector pending a token |
| Capabilities UI | `@local/dsh-capabilities` — left-sidebar page listing every connector and plugin, with probe/restart | live on `personal` |
| Channel | `@xmanrui/dsh-im` (mature Telegram/IM plugin) | **HOLD** — not certified for this DSH version and an open upstream bug (#547) breaks final-answer delivery |
| Security & telemetry | hardened systemd user unit, DSH telemetry egress disabled, nftables egress observe+alert, journald sink, digest timer, token/cost meter, backups + restore drill | live |

Deliberately **not** installed: the long tail of 0–3★ single-author market plugins (switchboard, heartbeat,
automations, push-notify, soul-md, …). They are rejected in [`research/plugin-ledger.md`](research/plugin-ledger.md);
where the capability matters, we wrote the small piece ourselves ([`plugins/`](plugins/)).

## Architecture

```
dsh-personal.service (systemd --user, 127.0.0.1:7002, tailnet via tailscale serve)
├─ DSH 0.2.2-rc.2 (profile "personal", home ~/.dsh-personal)
│  ├─ identity   @local/dsh-soul ──► $DSH_HOME/soul/SOUL.md (0600)
│  ├─ memory     @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents ──► Hindsight :9177, bank dsh-personal
│  ├─ recall     session-search (FTS5) ──► $DSH_HOME/storages/session-search.db
│  ├─ push       @local/dsh-push ──► ntfy (inert by default)
│  └─ heartbeat  @local/dsh-heartbeat (default OFF)
├─ local telemetry: journald · nftables egress observe+alert · token/cost · digest timer
└─ backups: ~/backups/dsh-personal (profile + workspace + Hindsight bank export)
```

### Decisions worth knowing

- **D13 — pragmatic security baseline.** Single-user host, accepted same-UID risk; instead of a dedicated
  OS user we keep telemetry egress off, egress observed and alerted, backups tested, plugins vetted and
  pinned. Full reasoning and residuals: security doc §7–§8.
- **D14 — mature plugins only.** Measured npm/GitHub adoption per candidate; no 0–3★ single-author packages
  on core surfaces; own the small glue instead.
- **Least mechanism.** One profile, bundle rows disableable one at a time; no core patches.

## Using the pieces

```sh
# unit tests (no host needed)
cd plugins/dsh-heartbeat && node --test          # 26 tests
node plugins/dsh-soul/selftest.mjs              # loader edge cases

# host checks (read-only)
scripts/telemetry/check-alerts.sh               # alerts: unit, Hindsight, backup age, egress
scripts/hardening/verify-unit-hardening.sh      # what systemd actually applied
sudo scripts/egress/observe.sh status           # egress observation target freshness

# backup + restore drill (live host untouched; drill on :7009)
scripts/backup/dsh-backup.sh
scripts/backup/dsh-restore-drill.sh --require-hindsight

# forget a memory document / clear the bank (human-invoked, bank-locked)
scripts/memory/forget.sh --list
scripts/memory/forget.sh --match <text> --yes
```

## Security notes for readers

- No credentials, tokens or captured prompts are in this repository (CI runs a secret-shaped string scan;
  raw captures are gitignored).
- The docs describe a real homelab host (private LAN IP, tailnet name, local ports). Nothing here is
  reachable from the public internet.
- Third-party bank names in the build log are redacted to placeholders.
- DSH is a developer preview: this build pins exact versions and treats every DSH/plugin upgrade as a
  re-vetting event. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) to report an issue.
