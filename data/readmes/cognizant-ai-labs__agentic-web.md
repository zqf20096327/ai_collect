## Hackathon

Register for the [DevPost hackathon](https://cognizant-agenticweb.devpost.com/) to build the first publicly accessible
interconnected agentic websites, the foundations of the world wide agentic web.

The [starter tools](#starter-tools) below are optional resources for participants. Registrants can
also claim free credits for [Mozilla's Otari](#mozillas-otari).


## Why

Today, personal AI agents are largely confined to the platforms that build and operate them.
Without open standards, the emerging agent economy risks reproducing the closed ecosystems of
today's internet, where access, visibility and interoperability are controlled by a handful of
companies.

The Open Agentic Web aims to change that. Its vision is a web where people and organizations
can choose their agents, businesses can make their services discoverable to any agent,
and agents can work across platforms regardless of who built them.


## What

An open agentic website is a public website that contains:
- a publicly accessible `.json` file that describes an agent network and its capabilities
- a `runtime` that can run the agent network in the browser
- an interface that allows users to interact with the agent network
- an interface that allows users to configure the LLM and keys to use
  
It must follow the [minimum viable specification](docs/worldwide_agentic_web_mvp_spec.md) for a worldwide agentic web.

### Key principles

- Agent networks are described in **JSON**, a human-readable **configuration** format. Not code.
- Agent networks are **executed in the browser**, without any specific server-side code.
- Users have control over which LLM providers and keys to use, so that the site host **does not pay for LLM calls**.
- Users have control over which sites they visit and which agents they interact with.
- Agent networks can reference other agent networks by URL, allowing them to call and interact with each other.
- Agent networks can call MCP and WebMCP tools

### Existing web infrastructure

Open agentic websites use ordinary web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON), HTTPS hosting, CORS, WebMCP, MCP and standard web browsers. They are compatible with existing web infrastructure and can be deployed on any public hosting service.

## Spec

The minimum viable specification for a worldwide agentic web is described in [docs/worldwide_agentic_web_mvp_spec.md](docs/worldwide_agentic_web_mvp_spec.md).

## Agentic Websites

See the list of contributed [Agentic Websites](docs/agentic_websites.md):
- for examples and starting points that follow the Open Agentic Web principles
- to find other agents to connect to and grow the capabilities of your agent networks
- to contribute your own agentic websites and let people discover them. Pull requests welcome!

## Examples

The operator of a pizza restaurant wants to agentify their website so that:
- customers can interactively ask questions about the menu. For instance:
  - "What are the vegetarian options?"
  - "I'm lactose intolerant, what can I eat?"
- customers can interactively place orders and choose delivery options. The website can
 delegate the delivery task to other delivery agentic websites.
- other agentic websites can send requests like:
  - "I'm organizing a hackathon and want to order 10 pizzas for delivery at 6pm. Can you help me?"
  - "What's the status for order #12345?"

The LLM provider, model and key used to answer these questions are chosen by the user, not the pizza restaurant. The pizza restaurant does not pay for LLM calls.

## Quickstart

See the [Quickstart guide](docs/quickstart.md) to generate an agent network, build a website bundle, and test it with your own LLM provider API key.

## Agentifying an existing website

### Existing website

Start with the [simple pizza restaurant website](examples/pizza_restaurant/).
It is a standalone HTML, CSS and JavaScript example with a menu (including
ingredients and dietary information), a cart, and a demo pickup or delivery
checkout. It has no dependencies, backend or agent integration yet.

Run it from the repository root:

```shell
python -m http.server 8080 --directory ./examples/pizza_restaurant
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8080/. Add pizzas to the cart, adjust quantities,
choose pickup or delivery, and place a demo order to see its confirmation.
Orders stay in memory and no payment is collected or food ordered.

Use this as the existing website to agentify: ground menu answers in its menu
data and connect an agent's ordering tools to its cart and checkout logic.
See the [example's README](examples/pizza_restaurant/README.md) for the file layout.

### Agentified version

The [agentified pizza restaurant](examples/pizza_restaurant_agentified/) is a copy
of the existing website with the generated browser assistant embedded below its
menu and cart. The original website remains available on its own.  

To create this version,
[examples/pizza_restaurant_website_assistant.hocon](examples/pizza_restaurant_website_assistant.hocon)
and the generated [pizza_restaurant_website_assistant.network.json](examples/sites/pizza_restaurant_website_assistant_static/pizza_restaurant_website_assistant.network.json)
can be used as a starting point for the agent network.
Its agents need to be grounded in the restaurant's actual menu and cart next:

1. Copy the existing website:
   ```shell
   cp -R examples/pizza_restaurant examples/pizza_restaurant_agentified
   ```
2. Select components from
   [the generated static bundle](examples/sites/pizza_restaurant_website_assistant_static/):
   copy its `agent-manifest.json`,
   `pizza_restaurant_website_assistant.network.json`, `links.json`, and
   `agent-mcp.json` into the new directory. Copy the browser runtime from
   [skills/agentify-website/runtime/](skills/agentify-website/runtime/) instead of the
   bundle's `runtime/`: it is nsdeploy's runtime with the `website_*` tools of step 5.
   Keep the restaurant's HTML and styles; the generated bundle's full-page
   `index.html` and `theme.css` are not needed.
3. Add a mount point below the restaurant checkout in `index.html` and load
   `site.js` as a module. In [site.js](examples/pizza_restaurant_agentified/site.js),
   call the copied runtime's `boot()` with that mount point and URLs relative to
   the current site. The runtime provides chat, AI model settings, agent activity,
   structured action proposals, and a confirmation dialog.
4. Ground the network in the restaurant. Update the copied network's instructions
   to use actual menu and order data, remove instructions to invent demo results,
   and resolve the ordering and delivery specialists as local agents. `site.js`
   appends the current menu, cart, prices and latest local order to each agent
   invocation. All agents read the same state used by the restaurant UI.
5. Connect website operations. Export shared state and checkout functions from
   `script.js`; register `get_restaurant_state`, `add_to_cart`, `set_cart`, and
   `checkout_demo_order` in
   [restaurant-actions.js](examples/pizza_restaurant_agentified/restaurant-actions.js).
   Declare this module in the manifest's `actions` field and list the read/cart
   and checkout operations in `actions.agentTools`. The copied runtime's `runner.js` includes
   a bridge that exposes those operations as model-callable `website_*` tools.
   The agent calls `website_add_to_cart` to run the site's code immediately and
   receives a receipt with the updated cart. `website_checkout_demo_order` is
   also a callable tool, gated by the engine's confirmation callback. It opens
   a review dialog containing the cart, total and fulfillment details before
   calling the shared `submitOrder()` function. All arguments are schema-validated.
   CRUSE forms still collect missing details together: submitting an intake form
   passes its values to the agent, which then calls the checkout tool. Collecting
   answers and confirming order placement remain separate steps.
   The `render_cruse` tool attaches widgets directly to the response, preserving
   them through plain-text final answers and specialist handoffs. The response
   parser also accepts structured CRUSE JSON without a code fence.
   Cart changes appear in the existing cart; checkout uses the same validation
   and confirmation as the manual form. A cart version check rejects checkout
   if the cart has changed since checkout was prepared.
6. Serve the copy over HTTP (ES modules and runtime configuration need a server):
   ```shell
   python -m http.server 8080 --directory ./examples/pizza_restaurant_agentified
   ```
   Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/, scroll to **Ask Little Oven**, and expand
   **⚙ AI model settings**. Paste your [Otari](#mozillas-otari) API key, then select
   **Save and start**. The example uses hosted Otari and
   `alibaba/qwen-3.5-35b-a3b` by default. For another provider, select it in the panel,
   which fills in its provider URL and model, or enter both under
   **Advanced settings (optional)**. The provider must allow requests from the browser.
   The selected provider receives the chat and restaurant context; LLM calls use
   the customer's credentials.

Try asking “What are the vegetarian options?” or “Add two Margherita pizzas to
my cart.” The agent calls the cart tool and the visible cart updates. Then ask
for pickup or delivery checkout. Provide a name and, for delivery, an address; review the cart
and total in the checkout tool's confirmation dialog. Its receipt and the
restaurant confirmation show the resulting demo order.

This version supports menu questions, shared-cart updates, demo checkout and
the latest local order's `received` status. Orders still live only in page memory;
no food is ordered or payment collected. Delivery is a simulated choice, with
no external delivery delegation or live tracking. The copied `agent-mcp.json`
explicitly marks the public MCP facade unavailable: static hosting alone does
not provide a server for other websites to submit orders. See the
[agentified example's README](examples/pizza_restaurant_agentified/README.md)
for component details and verification instructions.

### Agentify your own website

The [agentify-website skill](skills/agentify-website/SKILL.md) walks a coding agent
through the same steps for any website, given its source folder or a public URL. Ask
your agent to read and follow `skills/agentify-website/SKILL.md`. It needs Node.js 22
or newer.

[`examples/guesthouse/`](examples/guesthouse/) is a plain guesthouse booking site, and
[`examples/guesthouse_agentified/`](examples/guesthouse_agentified/) is the version an
agent made by following the skill.

## Connect to other agent networks

To expand the capabilities of your agent networks, connect them to other [Agentic Websites](docs/agentic_websites.md).

An agent calls another site's network by its URL: the folder that holds that site's
`agent-manifest.json`, then the network name, such as
`https://partner.example/partner_network`. List that URL in the agent's `tools`, and the
partner's origin in `allowed_peers` in your `agent-manifest.json`: unless `peer_policy`
is `"open"`, the runtime refuses every other origin. Before anything is sent, the
visitor agrees on a card. The partner's network then runs in the visitor's browser, on
the visitor's own key. It gets none of the partner site's own functions, so it can say
what that site offers and point to its page, but not give live availability or book.

For a site agentified with the skill, follow
[`references/linking.md`](skills/agentify-website/references/linking.md). The build
writes the `bridge/` page that other agent sites load before they run your network, and
`scripts/check_partner.mjs` checks a partner before you add it.
[`examples/harbor_tours_agentified/`](examples/harbor_tours_agentified/) (made from
[`examples/harbor_tours/`](examples/harbor_tours/)) and
[`examples/guesthouse_agentified/`](examples/guesthouse_agentified/) call each other.
Their READMEs show how to serve both on two host names.


## Infrastructure

Build tools and infrastructure for the agentic web: what will simplify the creation, deployment,
and discovery of agentic websites? What will make them more useful?


## Starter tools

These optional tools can help you get started quickly with building agentic web applications.

### Cognizant AI Lab’s Neuro SAN

[Neuro SAN Studio](https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san-studio) is an open-source framework
for building and orchestrating multi-agent systems.
Try the [hosted version](https://neuro-san.evolution.ml/) with your own LLM keys. Use it to quickly prototype and test your agent networks.

### Mozilla’s Otari

[Otari](https://otari.ai) by Mozilla.ai is an open-source AI infrastructure platform and LLM gateway.
Use it to manage your LLM keys and build applications and agents with the models you choose,
including open-weight models, without being locked into a single provider.

Otari is optional. If you'd like to try it during the hackathon:
- **Claim your credits.** Hackathon registrants get free Otari credits (limited to the first 100
  registrants). Sign up at [otari.ai](https://otari.ai), then redeem the voucher code shared with
  registered participants on your [billing page](https://otari.ai/dashboard#/organization/billing).
- **Get help.** Join the [Mozilla OSAI Discord](https://discord.gg/AzMfpN3VNS), select the
  `agentic-hackathon` role in Channels & Roles, and ask in `#otari-ai`. The Otari developers are there.
- **Share feedback.** Post in `#otari-ai` or
  [open an issue](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/otari/issues). Issues and pull requests on the
  [Otari repo](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/otari) are welcome, and so are stars.

An open agentic website can use Otari as its LLM router:
- **Hosted Otari** (`https://api.otari.ai/api/v1`) allows calls from the browser, so a
  static site can use it with your Otari API key. Some models fail on every request, so
  start with `alibaba/qwen-3.5-35b-a3b`. The examples in this repo use hosted Otari with
  that model by default.
- **Self-hosted Otari** works once you allow the site's origin in Otari's
  `cors_allow_origins`. It can also run local models through Ollama, with no provider key.

See [Using Otari](docs/providers/otari.md) for the steps, and
[LLM providers](docs/providers/providers.md) for other providers.

### NANDA’s Index agent registry

[Nanda Index](https://nandaindex.org/) lets agents find and verify one another across the network. Use it to find other agents, register your own agents, and verify the authenticity of agents you interact with.


## Testing

> [!NOTE]
> TODO
Run the validation script to check your submission is compliant.

## Documentation

### Definition of an agent in .json

An agent is defined as part of an **agent network**. The published `.network.json`
file is a data-only description of the agents, their instructions, and the
capabilities they can call. JSON is a valid serialization of the canonical HOCON
representation; published files must have includes and substitutions resolved and
must not depend on local files or environment variables. See
[sections 2.1–2.2 of the MVP specification](docs/worldwide_agentic_web_mvp_spec.md#21-minimum-network-content).

The network's top-level `tools` array contains its agent definitions. Each agent has:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | A unique name within the network, used by other agents to reference it. |
| `function.description` | A description of what the agent can do, so callers can decide when to use it. |
| `function.parameters` | A JSON Schema describing the inputs accepted when calling the agent. |
| `instructions` | Instructions for the LLM: its role, grounding, constraints, and how to fulfill requests. |
| `tools` | The agents or capabilities it can call, such as local agent names, published peer-network URLs, or MCP descriptors. An empty list declares no downstream references. |

This shortened example follows the structure of the
[pizza restaurant network](examples/pizza_restaurant_agentified/pizza_restaurant_website_assistant.network.json).
It keeps only the coordinator and menu specialist, with simplified instructions
and invocation schemas:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Help customers with the Little Oven Pizza menu."
  },
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "front_desk_coordinator",
      "function": {
        "description": "Answer menu questions by consulting the menu specialist.",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "inquiry": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "required": ["inquiry"]
        }
      },
      "instructions": "Delegate menu questions to menu_specialist and summarize its answer. Never invent menu items or prices.",
      "tools": ["menu_specialist"]
    },
    {
      "name": "menu_specialist",
      "function": {
        "description": "Explain menu items, ingredients, dietary labels, allergens and prices.",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "inquiry": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "required": ["inquiry"]
        }
      },
      "instructions": "Use only the current Restaurant state supplied by the website. Explain when information is unavailable.",
      "tools": []
    }
  ]
}
```

The site's separate `agent-manifest.json` identifies the network through `name`,
selects its public entry point through `front_man` (here,
`front_desk_coordinator`), and points `hocon` to the published `.network.json`
file. See the [pizza restaurant manifest](examples/pizza_restaurant_agentified/agent-manifest.json).
The browser runtime loads this definition, runs the entry agent, and dispatches
its calls to the referenced specialists or tools.

The full pizza example also includes an invocation `mode` for its AAOSA
delegation protocol (`Determine`, `Fulfill`, or `Follow up`), shared instruction
fields, `llm_config`, an execution time limit, and presentation and deployment
settings. These illustrate additional configuration beyond the basic agent
definition. Model settings are hints; when loading a peer network, the caller's
active router and model policy take precedence.

Instructions alone do not supply live data or execute website operations. The
pizza website supplies current restaurant state and registers cart and checkout
actions with the runtime. Action arguments are validated, and checkout requires
browser confirmation. Published definitions and instructions are public: keep
credentials out of them and explicitly control any private context shared across
agent-site boundaries.
