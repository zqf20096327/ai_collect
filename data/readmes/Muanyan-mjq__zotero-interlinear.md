# Interlinear

Read foreign-language papers in Zotero 10 with a translation under every paragraph.

Interlinear plugs into the desktop PDF reader's reading mode, fetches a translation for each structured paragraph, and renders it right next to the source — so you can keep reading instead of copying text into a translator.

## Features

- **Five built-in translation services.** Google Translate works out of the box with no API key. OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and Ollama are one settings page away. No companion plugin is required.
- **Four layouts.** Translation below the source, side-by-side columns, translation only, or source only. A dedicated display-mode button cycles through them; side-by-side keeps the first lines aligned without disturbing Zotero's native highlights.
- **One toolbar toggle.** The main toolbar button starts a translation run, then shows or hides the result. While a run is in progress, clicking it pauses and hides; clicking again shows the translations and resumes unfinished paragraphs. Each reader keeps its own state.
- **Translate as you read.** Rest the pointer on a paragraph, press your custom shortcut, Alt-click, or select text — each triggers a single-paragraph translation without starting a full-document run.
- **Full-document runs that behave.** Progress and cancel from the toolbar, viewport-first ordering that re-sorts as you page, short-paragraph batching, concurrency and rate limits, timeouts, automatic pause after repeated failures, and click-to-retry on any failed paragraph.
- **Glossary.** Import/export CSV or TSV term lists. Terms are injected into LLM prompts and enforced as a post-translation replacement on every service, including Google.
- **Reading assistant.** A chat sidebar answers questions about the selected paragraph, the current page, or the whole document (LLM services only).
- **Bilingual PDF export.** The current source-plus-translation view is re-typeset into a searchable PDF and attached to the Zotero item.
- **Appearance control with live preview.** Six built-in presets (Default, Eye-friendly paper, Academic serif, High contrast, Optimized dark, Minimal) apply in one click and can be undone. Includes a searchable installed-font list with favorites, a font-stack builder with up to six fallbacks, automatic per-language font stacks, a custom HSV color picker (hue/saturation/opacity/RGB/HSL/HEX), separate light/dark colors, recent and saved colors, text decoration (underline/overline/strikethrough with style/thickness/offset), paragraph dividers, ribbon position/width/style, block layout (padding/radius/border/indent/alignment/max width/opacity/source dimming), named presets, and JSON import/export.
- **Caching.** Translations are cached per service, language pair, and glossary, with a one-click cleanup in settings.
- English and Simplified Chinese UI; errors appear as non-blocking notices inside the reader.

## Install

1. Download the latest `interlinear.xpi` from [Releases](https://github.com/Muanyan-mjq/zotero-interlinear/releases).
2. In Zotero: **Tools → Plugins → gear icon → Install Plugin From File…**, then pick the `.xpi`.
3. Restart Zotero if prompted.

Requires **Zotero 10 (desktop)**. See [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) if you are coming from the original plugin.

## Configuration

Open **Edit → Settings → Interlinear**. The page uses five tabs; the save bar and tab strip stay visible while you scroll, and modified fields show an unsaved-changes hint:

- **Translation service** — pick a backend and fill in its endpoint, model, and API key; choose source and target languages. Each backend has a **Test connection** button that reports running, success, or the actual failure reason in place.
- **Display & interaction** — default layout, hover translation (on/off, dwell delay, and no modifier / hold Alt / hold Ctrl), the single-paragraph shortcut, and optional show/hide and layout-cycle shortcuts with conflict warnings.
- **Appearance** — live preview, six built-in presets and named presets, installed-font detection and stack builder, color picker with per-theme values, text decoration, paragraph dividers, ribbon, block layout, interface-follow and export appearance. Advanced groups start collapsed.
- **Glossary** — import/export term files.
- **Advanced** — translation scope (body/headings/captions/list items/notes), skip trailing pages, speed and reliability knobs, auto-translate on open (off / cache only / always), translation cache usage and cleanup, plus version and project links.

> **Privacy note.** Translating sends paragraph text to the service you choose. API keys are stored as plaintext in Zotero preferences; they are never written to logs or cache keys. Do not translate sensitive documents with a service you do not trust.

## Usage

1. Open a PDF in Zotero and switch to **reading mode**.
2. Left-click the Interlinear toolbar icon to start a full-document run. Once translations exist, the same button hides them to show the original, and shows them again; if a run is in progress the first click pauses it, and a paused run resumes when translations are shown again. Right-click the icon for retranslate, cancel, export, and settings.
3. The display-mode button next to it cycles the four layouts. Failed or paused paragraphs show a retry affordance — click it to retry just that paragraph.
4. While reading, hover a paragraph, use your shortcut, Alt-click, or select text to translate just that part. During a full run, these reuse in-flight requests instead of calling the service twice.
5. Open the reading assistant from the reader sidebar to ask questions about the selection, the current page, or the whole document; export the bilingual view as a PDF attachment from the toolbar menu.

## Known limitations

- Desktop Zotero 10 only; there is no mobile or Zotero 7 support.
- The plugin relies on Zotero's internal reading-mode interfaces, which are not a public API — a Zotero upgrade may break it until adapted.
- Math formulas are not translated; tables are not translated cell-by-cell; figure content is not extracted.
- Scanned PDFs work only as well as Zotero's own text layer.
- Export re-typesets the reading view; it does not overlay translations on the publisher's original PDF pages.
- Default pair is English → Simplified Chinese; other pairs depend on the chosen service and model.

## Roadmap (planned)

Planned, not implemented, no committed timeline:

- Cell-level table translation.
- Adapting to reading-mode interface changes in future Zotero releases.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # type-check + package .scaffold/build/interlinear.xpi
npm run lint:check   # ESLint
npm run test:unit    # Node unit tests, no Zotero needed
npm run test:gui     # capture real preference-window screenshots into docs/dev/screenshots
npm run test:e2e     # provider e2e: mock protocols by default
npm start            # dev server; set ZOTERO_PLUGIN_ZOTERO_BIN_PATH in .env first
```

Integration tests run against a real headless Zotero:

```bash
ZOTERO_PLUGIN_ZOTERO_BIN_PATH="/path/to/zotero" npm run test:review
# or the standard scaffold entry:
ZOTERO_PLUGIN_ZOTERO_BIN_PATH="/path/to/zotero" npm test
```

`npm run test:e2e` also covers a real local Ollama model and a real Google
request through a local proxy when the matching environment variables are set:

```bash
INTERLINEAR_TEST_OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b INTERLINEAR_TEST_GOOGLE_PROXY_PORT=7897 \
ZOTERO_PLUGIN_ZOTERO_BIN_PATH="/path/to/zotero" npm run test:e2e
```

On Windows the path is typically `C:\Program Files\Zotero\zotero.exe`. CI runs lint, builds on Ubuntu/macOS, and executes the test suite on every push to `main`.
