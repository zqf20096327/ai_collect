# svolder

Control Schiit Audio devices that carry the Forkbeard Bluetooth LE module from Linux: a CLI, a TUI,
a background daemon, a web UI, Home Assistant over MQTT and an MCP server for AI assistants. Named
after the Battle of Svolder, won by Sweyn Forkbeard, son of Harald Bluetooth.

We come in peace: svolder is a fan's homage to Schiit's engineering, and Schiit Audio has not made,
endorsed or reviewed it (see [LEGAL.md](LEGAL.md)). If you find it useful, the best way to say
thanks is to buy Schiit. It knows Schiit's Forkbeard DACs, preamps, amplifiers and phono stages
through a profile per model.

## Before you plug in

svolder is beta software. It has been tested against a fake device and a Bluetooth simulator that
speaks the Forkbeard protocol, and has not yet driven real Schiit hardware. Until it has, treat
every first run as a test:

- Turn the volume down before svolder connects, on the device or on the amplifier after it, and
  start low.
- Try it with cheap headphones or speakers first, and keep headphones off your ears while you try a
  new device, a new version of svolder or a new feature.
- Cap the ways in from other devices: `max_volume_db` under `[web]`, `[mqtt]` and `[mcp]` in
  `config.toml` refuses any volume above it.
- If something sounds or looks wrong, take the headphones off, turn the volume down on the device,
  and stop svolder with `svolder daemon stop`.
- Tell us what happened, with the output of `svolder doctor`, in an
  [issue](https://github.com/RRAlex/svolder/issues).

[LEGAL.md](LEGAL.md) says the same, and you use svolder at your own risk.

## Install

Get the current version from the [release page](https://github.com/RRAlex/svolder/releases/latest),
for x86_64 and arm64, each file listed in `SHA256SUMS`:

- Debian, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS: `sudo apt install ./svolder_<version>_amd64.deb`
  (`_arm64.deb` on arm64, Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit)
- Fedora, RHEL: `sudo dnf install ./svolder-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm`
- Arch: `PKGBUILD` and the tarball in one folder, then `makepkg -si`
- Nix: `nix run github:RRAlex/svolder/v<version>`
- Any Linux: the `x86_64-linux` or `aarch64-linux` tarball; static binaries, BlueZ only
- Container: `docker pull ghcr.io/rralex/svolder:<version>`

On a Raspberry Pi whose Bluetooth is blocked or whose service is stopped, `svolder doctor` names the
fix; see [Raspberry Pi](docs/usage/bluetooth.md#raspberry-pi).

A package enables nothing: turn the daemon on with
`systemctl --user enable --now svolderd.socket svolderd.service` (from a tarball:
`svolder daemon install`). [Getting started](docs/usage/getting-started.md) and
[The daemon](docs/usage/daemon.md) have every file, a machine nobody logs in to and the container.
To build from source, run `make deps` then `make build` (Rust 1.93 or later);
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#build) lists the tools.

## First steps

    svolder setup                 # scan, name the device, offer to install the daemon
    svolder                       # the TUI, or the setup wizard the first time
    svolder doctor                # check the host and the daemon, and offer fixes
    svolder status                # every control's value
    svolder set volume -20dB      # set a control by its key; `svolder set mute on`
    svolder eq show               # the tone control; `eq load`, `eq set`, `eq search` AutoEq
    svolder web                   # the web UI, signed in; `web --qr` for a phone
    svolder daemon install        # keep every device connected for the whole login

No device at hand: `svolder tui --demo` runs the TUI on a fake device and a throwaway daemon, and
touches nothing of yours. `make demo` adds `--host --web`: the same fake device with your computer's
real audio (volume, player, EQ) and the web UI on a free port, for trying the themes with your own
music; `make demo-safe` is the plain one.

### Home Assistant

The daemon publishes each device to an MQTT broker, and Home Assistant's MQTT integration finds it
on its own. Add a section to `~/.config/svolder/config.toml`:

```toml
[mqtt]
enabled = true
host = "192.168.1.10"     # the broker, such as Home Assistant's Mosquitto add-on
username = "svolder"      # and SVOLDER_MQTT_PASSWORD in the daemon's environment
commands = true           # let Home Assistant change things; leave it out for read-only
max_volume_db = -20.0     # Home Assistant never sets the volume above this
```

Then run `svolder daemon restart`; `svolder daemon status` says when the bridge is connected. With
the MQTT integration on the same broker, each device appears with its controls.
[contrib/home-assistant](contrib/home-assistant/README.md) has the broker and login steps and a
dashboard to paste in, and [MQTT and Home Assistant](docs/usage/mqtt.md) has every entity and
topic.

### AI assistants (MCP)

The daemon can serve the Model Context Protocol on this machine, read-only unless you allow writes:

```toml
[mcp]
enabled = true            # 127.0.0.1:8737; add writes = true to let it change things
```

Run `svolder daemon restart`, then register it with Claude Code, pasting the token that
`svolder mcp token` prints:

    claude mcp add --transport http svolder http://127.0.0.1:8737/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

[The MCP server](docs/usage/mcp.md) covers other clients, the volume rule and the tools.
